Defendants CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS Caremark” or the “Company”), Thomas
M. Ryan, David Rickard, and Howard McLure (collectively the “Individual Defendants” and,
together with CVS Caremark, the “Defendants”) respectfully submit this memorandum of law in
support of their motion to dismiss the Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint, filed June
1, 2010 (the “Complaint”),1 pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) and
section 78u-4(b) of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
As this Court has noted, Congress enacted the PSLRA in 1995 to put an end to the
abusive practice of filing securities fraud claims against public companies whenever their stock
prices decline. Rosen v. Textron, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 308, 316-17 (D.R.I. 2004) (Smith, J.).
One of the chief abuses that Congress sought to stop was suits claiming fraud whenever a
company lowers its financial forecasts. To achieve this aim, Congress enacted a heightened
pleading standard for all securities fraud claims and, in particular, a safe harbor at the pleading
stage for forward-looking statements like earnings projections.
This action is precisely the sort of case at which the PSLRA is aimed. Plaintiffs seek to
recover for the alleged loss in value of CVS Caremark stock following the Company’s
November 5, 2009 third-quarter earnings call (the “November Call”). Three months earlier, on
the Company’s August 4, 2009 second-quarter earnings call, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer, Thomas M. Ryan, had expressed his preliminary view on the Company’s earnings
outlook for 2010 (the “Preliminary Earnings Prediction”). On the November Call, Mr. Ryan

1

Plaintiff Medoff filed an initial complaint on November 17, 2009. Nearly six months later, on May 3,
2010, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint. The Complaint is a corrected version of the
May 3, 2010 complaint.

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 12 of 57

provided more formal guidance, lowering the expectation for 2010 earnings expressed in his
Preliminary Earnings Prediction. The reason for the adjustment in expectations, Mr. Ryan
explained, was substantial and unexpected losses since August 2009 in the Company’s pharmacy
benefit management (“PBM”) business.
Plaintiffs do not allege that any of CVS Caremark’s actual financial results were
misstated. Nor do plaintiffs dispute that the PBM business losses described in the November
Call do, in fact, explain the difference between the Preliminary Earnings Prediction and the
earnings guidance provided by Mr. Ryan on the November Call. Instead, they now claim, with
the benefit of hindsight, that the Preliminary Earnings Prediction must have been fraudulent
because the Company should have foreseen those business losses and therefore knew that the
Preliminary Earnings Prediction was false at the time it was given. The lengthy Complaint also
includes a profusion of other generalized allegations of misstatements or omissions about CVS
Caremark’s PBM business and about other specific contract losses that were publicly known
well before the November Call. Each of plaintiffs’ allegations fails to meet the heightened
pleading burdens under the PSLRA.
First, Mr. Ryan’s Preliminary Earnings Prediction of the Company’s future economic
performance is protected by the PSLRA’s statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements
for two independent reasons. The Preliminary Earnings Prediction was accompanied by
meaningful cautionary language and, under the PSLRA and well-established First Circuit law, is
protected for that reason alone. Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 201 (1st Cir. 1999);
Scritchfield v. Paolo, 274 F. Supp. 2d 163, 177 (D.R.I. 2003) (Smith, J.). In addition, plaintiffs
do not plead facts sufficient to allege that Mr. Ryan had actual knowledge that the Preliminary
Earnings Prediction was false or misleading when made, as they must under the PSLRA’s safe

2

harbor. In Scritchfield, this Court applied the PSLRA’s safe harbor to dismiss claims based on
several forward-looking statements, including a similar earnings prediction. 274 F. Supp. 2d at
187. As this Court explained: “That [the Company] ultimately may have been unable to realize
its dreams cannot transmogrify hopeful predictions into fraudulent dictions. ” Id. at 181.
Second, plaintiffs have not pled loss causation—a causal link between the alleged
misstatement and plaintiffs’ alleged losses—for the remainder of the alleged misstatements and
omissions in the Complaint. Plaintiffs do not and cannot contend that any of these statements
was addressed, much less “corrected,” on the November Call; as a result, the stock price drop
following the November Call cannot—as a matter of law—have been caused by any of these
alleged misstatements or omissions. For example, each and every one of the other alleged PBM
contract losses that are collectively the focus of dozens of paragraphs in the Complaint was
publicly known before the call, in fact often months before. Because the market was fully aware
of these losses before November 5, none of these alleged misstatements or omissions could
therefore have caused the loss in stock price value on that day for which the Complaint now
seeks to recover. Under a straightforward application of the United States Supreme Court’s
holding in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005), the Court must reject as
irrelevant and inactionable the vast majority of the allegations in the Complaint.
Third, even if the Complaint could adequately allege loss causation for the alleged
misstatements or omissions other than the Preliminary Earnings Prediction, the vast majority
should be rejected because they are inactionable. Because it is well settled that a company need
not disclose an outcome that is merely likely, as opposed to substantially certain, plaintiffs
cannot recover based on allegations that the Company did not disclose contracts that it was
allegedly “likely” to lose. And statements like “our model is working,” “we are seeing new

business opportunities in 2010,” and “our sales team is very optimistic about the opportunities
that lie ahead” are classic examples of the sort of allegations that this and other Courts routinely
and properly reject as inactionable puffery. See, e.g., Scritchfield, 274 F. Supp. 2d at 174.
Finally, plaintiffs’ Complaint must be dismissed in its entirety for the separate and
independent reason that plaintiffs have failed to meet their heightened burden under the PSLRA
of pleading a strong inference of scienter—i.e., pleading that defendants engaged in conscious
wrongdoing or acted with a high degree of recklessness—with respect to any of the alleged
misstatements or omissions. The Supreme Court has instructed that, for plaintiffs to meet this
burden at the pleading stage, the inference of scienter must be “cogent and at least as compelling
as any opposing inferences one could draw.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551
U.S. 308, 324 (2007). Plaintiffs seek to meet this burden by reference to stock trades by Messrs.
Ryan, Rickard, and McLure and supposed statements by confidential witnesses. Defendants’
overall pattern of trading—including their use of “10b5-1 plans,” pursuant to which their stock
was sold automatically during certain trading windows—does not, however, support any
inference of scienter. Nor do the allegations attributed to the confidential witnesses. This is not
surprising given that more than half of these witnesses had concededly left CVS Caremark prior
to the alleged class period (and well before the Preliminary Earnings Prediction); most are not
alleged to have met, let alone worked with, any of the Individual Defendants; and none is alleged
to have any knowledge whatsoever of the forecasting process.
Plaintiffs have had six-and-a-half months since the filing of their initial complaint to meet
their steep pleading burden. During that time, they purportedly interviewed scores of witnesses
and generated a lengthy complaint. But that length is largely a result of their inclusion of
irrelevant facts, inactionable purported misstatements, and unsupported assertions of scienter. At

its core, this remains a typical fraud-by-hindsight claim in which plaintiffs seek to recover
because the Company was unsuccessful in perfectly predicting its future earnings. This is
precisely the type of claim that Congress intended to eliminate with the PSLRA, and the Court
here should dismiss it with prejudice.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND2
CVS Caremark is an integrated provider of prescriptions and related health services
headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. (Compl. ¶ 15, 34.) The Individual Defendants
were executives of CVS Caremark during the relevant time. Mr. Ryan was the Company’s
Executive Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) (Compl. ¶ 28); Mr.
Rickard was its Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Executive Vice President (Compl. ¶ 29);
and Mr. McLure was the President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, the PBM division of CVS
Caremark (Compl. ¶ 30).
CVS Corp. merged with Caremark Rx Inc. in 2007 to form the combined Company.
(Compl ¶ 1.) Broadly speaking, CVS Caremark operates two business divisions: its retail
pharmacy business and its PBM business. (Compl. ¶ 35.) The retail pharmacy business operates
retail drugstores which sell prescription drugs and other general merchandise. (Compl. ¶ 35.)
The PBM business administers drug benefit programs on behalf of employers, government
agencies, health maintenance organizations, and other entities that provide prescription drug
insurance to their members. (Compl. ¶ 38.) The PBM business does so by entering into
contracts with these entities to provide PBM services to them. (Compl. ¶ 38.) This business is
highly competitive, and the revenue stream of the PBM division and, correspondingly, of the

documents and other sources central to plaintiffs’ claim or sufficiently referred to in the Complaint. See Watterson
v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993).

Company as a whole can be impacted in substantial ways by wins or losses of large PBM
contracts. (Compl. ¶ 34.)
The Preliminary Earnings Prediction
On August 4, 2009, the Company announced its earnings for the second quarter of 2009.
On a conference call that day to discuss those earnings (the “August Call”), Mr. Ryan provided
preliminary views of the Company’s earnings expectations for 2010—the Preliminary Earnings
Prediction. After explaining that he was “not giving guidance for 2010,” Mr. Ryan said:
I would be very disappointed if we didn’t have an EPS growth of at least 13 to
15% next year. As I said, we haven’t completed our plan for 2010, and it is too
early to give specific guidance, but I did want to give you some visibility on the
Med D impact.
(Compl. ¶ 160; Ex. 3, transcript of the CVS Caremark second-quarter 2009 earnings conference
call (the “Aug. 4 Tr.”) at 2.)3 In addition to Mr. Ryan’s own cautionary statements about the
earliness and imprecision of the Preliminary Earnings Prediction, the Company also identified it
as a forward-looking statement at the time it was made. At the outset of the August Call, Nancy
R. Christal, CVS Caremark’s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, announced that the
presentation would include “certain forward-looking statements” and that the Company claimed
“the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.” (Ex. 6, Aug. 4 Tr. at 2.)

Ms. Christal also warned investors that forward-looking statements made on the call “are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially” and directed
investors to the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements of the
Company’s most recently filed Form 10-Q and the Risk Factors section of the Company’s most
recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. (Id. at 2.) The 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter of
2009 (the “Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q”) included cautionary statements warning investors that
“all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties” and emphasizing that “[a]ctual
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a
number of reasons.”4 (Ex. 3, Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q at 32.) The 10-K for the period ended
December 31, 2008 (the “2008 10-K”) warned investors of specific risks associated with the
Company’s business, including its PBM business. (Ex. 1, 2008 10-K at 12, 20.)
The November 5, 2009 Call
On November 5, 2009, CVS Caremark reported results for its fiscal third quarter ending
September 30, 2009 and held a conference call to discuss those results. On that call, Mr. Ryan
provided guidance on the Company’s 2010 earnings outlook,5 which fell short of the Preliminary
Earnings Prediction. Mr. Ryan explained that “operating profit in the PBM will decline in 2010,
perhaps as much as 10 to 12%” and he further explained that, as a result, he no longer expected
that the Company would achieve the 13 to 15% growth rate in 2010 he had preliminarily
4

In particular, the 10-Q contained warnings of specific risk factors that could lead to differences between
results predicted in Mr. Ryan’s statement and actual results, including: “[o]ur ability to realize fully the incremental
revenues and other benefits from the Caremark merger”; “[t]he possibility of client loss and/or the failure to win
new client business”; “[t]he effect on our Pharmacy Services business of a declining margin environment
attributable to increased competition in the pharmacy benefit management industry and increased client demands for
lower prices, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels”; “[r]isks regarding the impact of the Medicare
prescription drug benefit on our business”; and “[l]itigation, legislative and regulatory risks associated with our
business or the . . . pharmacy benefit management industry generally.” (Ex. 3, Second Quarter 2009 10-Q at 32-33.)
5

The Company customarily first provides formal guidance on the earnings outlook for a prospective year
no earlier than the third-quarter earnings call of the prior year.

predicted in August. (Compl. ¶ 182.) Mr. Ryan also announced that Mr. McLure “will be
retiring effective November 27.” (Ex. 7, transcript of the CVS Caremark third-quarter 2009
earnings conference call (the “Nov. 5 Tr.”) at 5.) CVS Caremark shares declined following the
November Call. (Compl. ¶ 212.)
On the November Call, Mr. Ryan explained the unforeseen developments in the PBM
business that had made the Preliminary Earnings Prediction unattainable: namely, the loss of a
contract with the State of New Jersey, the loss of Medicare low-income subsidy (“LIS”) business
in 15 regions (accounting for the overwhelming majority of the 10-12% loss he projected for the
PBM business), the loss of the managed Medicare business for the State of Ohio, the early
renegotiation—at the request of the client—of a contract with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal
Employees Plan (“FEP”), and $600 million in other, smaller contract losses:
We had $1.4 billion in wins in 2010. Approximately, 600 million of those gross
wins came since the last quarterly call. We had 4.5 billion in losses and
approximately two plus billion of those came from the last call—since the last call,
and those would be Horizon, I think you know about obviously the State of New
Jersey. This was a bid that the state wanted on a stand-alone basis, so it was a
kind of price and carve-out issue. We lost the State of Ohio and the managed
Medicare business. It was carved in, which is about 500 plus million. And then
we had another 600 million miscellaneous. These were basically smaller clients
around RxAmerica or PharmaCare that just really wanted essentially smaller
PBMs. So in total, that was about $2 plus billion since the last call.
And then, lastly, we had $1.7 billion that we lost in Med-D business. This was
the 500,000 lives that we lost in the duals, and once again, this was since the last
call. So net-net, it’s about $4.8 billion in loss—in net loss for 2010 and
approximately almost 3.7 billion since the last call.
...
To get to that 13 to 15% growth rate, I expected strong double-digit growth in our
retail business, which I still do, and I expected low-to-mid single digit in our PBM
business, which is not going to happen. What’s changed? Well, as I just said, we
lost more PBM business than we expected since the call, $2 billion in contracts.
We lost the Med-D duals in 15 regions, which was 1.7 billion, which I just
referred to. And we extended the $4 billion FEP contract through 2011 at the

client’s request. This was an early renegotiation, not at our request, but at the
client’s request. So we're going to have obviously some margin implications in
2010.
(See Ex. 7, Nov. 5 Tr. at 4-5.) Plaintiffs do not and cannot deny that these contract losses would
account for the difference between the Preliminary Earnings Prediction and the 2010 earnings
guidance provided by Mr. Ryan on the November Call; nor can they contend that any of these
contract losses occurred prior to the Preliminary Earnings Prediction. Instead, they contend that
the Company somehow knew that these losses were going to occur before they did. (Compl.
¶¶ 85, 110.)
The Filing of the Original Complaint
Seeking to recover based on the decline in CVS Caremark’s stock price, plaintiffs filed a
complaint on November 17, 2009, alleging that the Company and the Individual Defendants
violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 10b-5 and that the Individual Defendants
are liable as controlling persons under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The original
complaint alleged only that the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was somehow fraudulent; it did
not identify any other alleged misstatements or omissions that were purportedly revealed either
in the November Call or at any other prior point in time.
The Amended Complaint and the Other Alleged Misstatements and Omissions
The Consolidated Class Action Complaint was filed almost six months later—on May 3,
2010—followed by the Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint on June 1, 2010. The

9

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 20 of 57

Complaint includes an array of other allegations of alleged misstatements and omissions,6 none
of which is alleged to have been disclosed for the first time or corrected on the November Call.
Most of these alleged misstatements are inactionable corporate puffery regarding the
Company’s business prospects or the success of the 2007 merger. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 113 (“I
would say our model is working”); Compl. ¶ 135 (“[a]s we head into the 2010 selling season, our
sales team is very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead”); Compl. ¶ 150 (“this model
really is going to make a difference going forward”).) And the Complaint does not allege that
any of these statements was disclosed on the November Call—the only alleged “corrective
disclosure” date in the Complaint. (Compl. ¶ 179.)
In fact, plaintiffs concede that the vast majority of the alleged misstatements and
omissions described in the Complaint had been disclosed weeks or even months earlier.
Although the Complaint alleges that the November Call somehow revealed “the magnitude of
the lost business, including the loss of the New Jersey account, and the true impact on the
Company’s earnings” (Compl. ¶ 183), each of the major PBM contract losses and events that
plaintiffs describe in the Complaint had previously been disclosed:
• The Company confirmed the loss of the Coventry Health Care commercial business
(“Coventry”) on May 5, 2009. (Compl. ¶ 141.)
• The Company confirmed the loss of the Chrysler unionized retirees business
(“Chrysler”) on the August Call. (Compl. ¶ 163.)
• On the August Call, the Company also disclosed the impact on revenues of a Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) regulatory amendment requiring PBMs to
report as an administrative cost the difference, or spread, between the price a PBM
pays for a drug and the amount it is reimbursed for purchasing that drug (the “CMS
Spread Regulation”). (Compl. ¶ 152.)

6

The Complaint attributes these statements to Mr. Ryan or Mr. Rickard. The Complaint does not allege
that Mr. McLure made any false or misleading statements.

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

• The Company’s loss of the State of New Jersey (“New Jersey”)7 business was known
to the market as early as August 11, 2009. (See Ex. 12, August 11, 2009
NorthJersey.com article.)
• The Company announced, in a mid-quarter press release on October 2, 2009, the loss
of LIS members enrolled in its SilverScript and Accendo Medicare Part D plans as
well as the earnings per share impact of that loss. (Compl. ¶ 174.)
Scienter Allegations
In support of their claim that Defendants acted with the requisite scienter, plaintiffs rely
primarily on allegations of insider trading on behalf of the Individual Defendants. (Compl.
¶ 204.) But plaintiffs acknowledge that Messrs. Rickard and McLure traded pursuant to “pre
arranged 10b-5 trading plans.”8 (Compl. ¶ 205.) Plaintiffs also concede that Mr. Ryan made
only one trade during the alleged class period, which amounted to only a small percentage of his
total holdings of stock. (Compl. ¶ 109.)
The Complaint’s remaining scienter allegations, purportedly based on information from
confidential witnesses, include a variety of conflicting, irrelevant, and conclusory allegations
about the Defendants’ purported knowledge of contract losses, customer service and integration
issues, regulatory changes, and the success of the Company’s Maintenance Choice program.
(See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 65, 68, 69, 98, 110, 111.) None of these, however, is a particularized
allegation concerning any Defendant’s state of mind. None describes a single conversation or
meeting with any of the Individual Defendants; none describes how the specific contract losses
and other issues that the Individual Defendants purportedly knew about affected the Company’s

7

CVS Caremark provided PBM benefits to the State of New Jersey through a contract with Horizon Blue
Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. (Compl. ¶ 84.)
8

A 10b5-1 trading plan is a contract between a company executive and a broker that contains detailed
instructions to sell specified amounts of securities on particular dates or at specified prices. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(A).

forecasts; and, in any event, none describes in any way the process the Company used to reach
its Preliminary Earnings Prediction.
In fact, most of the confidential witnesses included in the Complaint did not work at the
Company during the alleged class period; the remainder only worked at the Company for small
portions of the alleged class period; only one confidential witness was employed by the
Company in August of 2009 when Mr. Ryan made his 2010 Earnings Projection. (See Compl.
¶ 33.) And most of the confidential witnesses are not alleged to have ever even met any of the
Individual Defendants, much less have particularized evidence of what those Individual
Defendants were thinking.
ARGUMENT
The elements of a securities fraud claim are (1) a material misrepresentation or omission,
(2) scienter, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, (5) economic
loss, and (6) loss causation. See Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005);
Rosen v. Textron, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 308, 316 (D.R.I. 2004) (Smith, J.).
To survive a motion to dismiss a securities fraud suit, plaintiffs must satisfy the
heightened pleading standards of both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA. See
Rosen, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 316; Scritchfield v. Paolo, 274 F. Supp. 2d 163, 170 (D.R.I. 2003)
(Smith, J.). Rule 9(b) requires that “[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.” FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). The PSLRA
“augments Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement.” Rosen, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 317. It further
requires that a complaint alleging a Rule 10b-5 violation shall (i) “specify each statement alleged
to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading” and (ii)
“state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the
required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1), (2).
12

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

The First Circuit has explained that these pleading requirements are “notably strict and
rigorous.” ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 58 n.7 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting
Greebel v. FTP Software Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 193 (1st Cir. 1999)). Because plaintiffs fail to meet
them, the Complaint must be dismissed. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(A) (where pleading
requirements are not met, “the court shall . . . dismiss the complaint”).
I.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM AS TO THE PRELIMINARY
EARNINGS PREDICTION
In their nearly one hundred-page Complaint, plaintiffs point to only a single alleged

misstatement that was actually addressed for the first time on the November Call: Mr. Ryan’s
Preliminary Earnings Prediction, made on the August Call, that he “would be very disappointed
if [CVS] didn’t have an EPS growth of at least 13 to 15% next year.”9 (Compl. ¶ 160.) But
plaintiffs cannot state a claim with respect to Mr. Ryan’s Preliminary Earnings Prediction
because, as a quintessentially forward-looking statement, it falls squarely within the safe harbor
of the PSLRA.
The PSLRA exempts forward-looking statements from securities fraud causes of action if
“the forward-looking statement is identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied
by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement . . . .” 15 U.S.C. §§ 77z2(c)(1)(A)(i),78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i); accord Baron v. Smith, 380 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2004); Rosen v.
Textron, 321 F. Supp. 2d 308, 321 (D.R.I. 2004) (Smith, J.); Scritchfield v. Paolo, 274 F. Supp.
2d 163, 177 (D.R.I. 2003) (Smith, J.). The PSLRA codified the bespeaks caution doctrine. See,
e.g., Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1213 n.23 (1st Cir. 1996), superseded on other
9

The Preliminary Earnings Prediction represented Ryan’s preliminary estimate, in August 2009, of the
Company’s earnings “next year” (i.e., in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010). It reflects not only the PBM
business, but all other business segments of the Company.

grounds by statute, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)-(2). “Under this doctrine, [a] forward looking
statement is not materially misleading if ‘accompanied by adequate cautionary disclosures.”’ In
re Cytyc Corp. Sec. Litig., No. Civ. A. 02-12399-NMG, 2005 WL 3801468, at *21 (D. Mass
Mar. 2, 2005) (quoting In re Focus Enhancements, Inc. Sec. Litig., 309 F. Supp. 2d 134, 162 (D.
Mass. 2001)). As the First Circuit has recognized, “when statements of ‘soft’ information such
as forecasts, estimates, opinions or projections are accompanied by cautionary disclosures that
adequately warn of the possibility that actual results or events may turn out differently, the ‘soft’
statements may not be materially misleading.” Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1213.
The Preliminary Earnings Prediction is, self-evidently, a textbook example of a forwardlooking statement. “Forward-looking statements are, generally speaking, statements that speak
predictively of the future.” In re Stone & Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig., 414 F.3d 187, 195 (1st Cir.
2005) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 15 U.S.C.
§ 78u-5(i)(1) (defining “forward-looking statement” to include predictive statements of “future
economic performance,” including projections of revenues, income, and earnings per share).
Courts have consistently invoked this straightforward, commonsense definition when assessing
motions to dismiss securities fraud claims. See, e.g., Isham v. Perini Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 28,
39-40 (D. Mass. 2009) (deeming “statements about anticipated revenue and earnings per share”
protected by PSLRA safe harbor); In re Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. Sec. Litig., 604 F. Supp.
2d 332, 341 (D. Mass. 2009) (deeming statement regarding projected “income per share”
protected by PSLRA safe harbor); Sekuk Global Enters. v. KVH Indus., No. Civ.A. 04-306ML,
2005 WL 1924202, at *11 (D.R.I. Aug. 11, 2005) (deeming statement predicting “revenue
growth in the range of 30-50%” protected by PSLRA safe harbor); Scritchfield, 274 F. Supp. 2d

14

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 25 of 57

at 187 (holding that CEO’s prediction of “$15 million in revenues by the end of 2000” is a nonactionable forward-looking statement).
Interpreting the PSLRA, the First Circuit has held that the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements like the Preliminary Earnings Prediction has “two alternative inlets”:
[T]he first shelters forward-looking statements that are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i). The
second inlet focuses on the state of mind of the defendant and precludes liability
for a forward-looking statement unless the maker of the statement had actual
knowledge it was false or misleading.
Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 201 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Smith & Wesson, 604
F. Supp. 2d at 340 (“A forward-looking statement is protected if it . . . includes a disclaimer
regarding risks and the possibility that results will differ from projections . . . or . . . the
executives of the company had no actual knowledge the statement was false or misleading.”).10
Thus the Preliminary Earnings Prediction is inactionable if either of these “two alternative
inlets” applies. As explained below, both do.
A.

The Preliminary Earnings Prediction Is Entitled to the Protection of the Safe
Harbor Because It Was Accompanied by Meaningful, Narrowly Tailored
Cautionary Statements.

The PSLRA’s safe harbor applies because the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was
accompanied by cautionary language that was “substantive and tailored to the specific future
projections, estimates or opinions . . . which the plaintiffs challenge.” Smith & Wesson, 604 F.

10

In addition, because the Preliminary Earnings Prediction is forward-looking, the PSLRA provides that
Defendants had no duty to update or correct it. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(d). The Complaint therefore alleges no more
than “the unfortunate but commonplace event of a publicly traded company failing to meet its revenue forecast,
coupled with a concomitant and predictable drop in share prices.” In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 399 F. Supp.

Supp. 2d at 341 (quoting In re Donald Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357, 371-72 (3d Cir.
1993)).
As an initial matter, the Preliminary Earnings Prediction contains all the indicia of
uncertainty that are the hallmarks of the doctrine. For instance, Mr. Ryan did not identify a
specific growth target, instead saying only that he “would be very disappointed if” earnings per
share were less than 13 to 15%. (Compl. ¶ 160.) Moreover, he specifically warned that “it is too
early to give specific guidance.” (Id.) Where similar caveats and cautionary language have
accompanied challenged statements, courts have found the statements so indefinite that they
bespeak caution. See, e.g., Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1220-21; Polin v. Conductron Corp., 552 F.2d 797,
807 n.28 (8th Cir. 1977) (finding statements to bespeak caution when results were “‘expected’ to
show improvement” and the Company saw a “‘possibility’ of a break-even soon”). The
equivocal nature of the Preliminary Earnings Prediction confirms that the statement reflected Mr.
Ryan’s view of the future—a view that was subject to unforeseen intervening events.
More fundamentally, the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was also accompanied by
precisely the sort of “clearly demarcated cautionary statement” that courts routinely hold satisfy
the safe harbor. Scritchfield, 274 F. Supp. 2d at 187 (deeming a CFO’s projection of future
revenues made in a newspaper article a forward-looking statement where the cautionary
language was included in an earlier-issued press release); see also Ex. 11, Exhibits 30 and 31 to
the Appendix to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Scritchfield. At the outset of the August Call,
the Company warned investors that forward-looking statements made on the call “are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially” and recommended that
investors
become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the
Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K
16

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

and . . . review the section entitled, ‘Cautionary Statement Concerning ForwardLooking Statements,’ in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
(Ex. 6, Aug. 4 Tr. at 2.) The Company’s Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q and 2008 10-K contain
detailed cautionary statements warning investors that “all forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties” and emphasizing that “[a]ctual results may differ materially from those
contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons.”11 (Ex. 3, SecondQuarter 2009 10-Q at 32.)
In fact, the list of risks identified in the Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q squarely addresses
plaintiffs’ allegations that the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was false or misleading because
potential client loss, systemic integration and service issues, and new government regulation
would prevent the Company from realizing 13 to 15% earnings growth. (See Compl. ¶ 165.)
The Company’s cautionary statements cover each of these risks:
•

“Our ability to realize fully the incremental revenues and other benefits from the
Caremark merger”;

•

“The possibility of client loss and/or the failure to win new client business”;

•

“The effect on our Pharmacy Services business of a declining margin environment
attributable to increased competition in the pharmacy benefit management industry and
increased client demands for lower prices, enhanced service offerings and/or higher
service levels”;

•

“Risks regarding the impact of the Medicare prescription drug benefit on our business”;
and

•

“Litigation, legislative and regulatory risks associated with our business or the . . .
pharmacy benefit management industry generally.”

11

It is well established that a company may “rely on this safe harbor when making an oral statement simply
by referring to the written document containing the cautionary language.” Cytyc, 2005 WL 3801468, at *21 & n.55;
see also In re Ibis Tech. Sec. Litig., 422 F. Supp. 2d 294, 311-12 & n.15 (D. Mass. 2006) (“[D]irect incorporation by
reference of cautionary statements in SEC filings is permissible and supports the application of the safe harbor
provisions.”).

(Ex. 3, Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q at 32-33 (emphasis added).) Moreover, detailed language in
the 2008 10-K warned investors of the specific risks associated with the particular regulation
identified in the Complaint—the CMS Spread Regulation—and the possibility of customer loss:
•

“[I]n January 2009, CMS issued a regulation with comment period . . . [requiring] that,
beginning in 2010, any difference between the drug price charged to Part D sponsors by a
PBM and the drug price paid by the PBM to the dispensing provider be treated as an
administrative cost, rather than a drug cost, to the Part D sponsor for purposes of
calculating both the subsidy payments by the government and the drug price to be
charged to enrollees. . . . The Medicare Drug Benefit continues to attract a high degree of
legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and the applicable government rules and regulations
continue to evolve. Accordingly, it is possible that legislative and regulatory
developments could materially affect our Medicare Part D business or profitability.”

•

“Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contract with clients to provide
prescription drugs and related health care services to plan participants. PBM client
contracts generally have terms approximating 3 years in duration. Accordingly,
approximately one third of a PBM’s customer base typically is subject to renewal each
year, and therefore we face challenges in competing for new business and retaining or
renewing business. . . . There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new
business on terms as favorable to the Company as the present terms. Accordingly, our
failure to renew or win PBM business could adversely affect our business, financial
position and results of operations.”

(Ex. 1, 2008 10-K at 12, 20 (emphasis added).)
In In re Parametric Technology Corp. Securities Litigation, 300 F. Supp. 2d 206 (D. Mass.
2001), the court held that similar cautionary language “comported with the requirement of the
statute.” Id. at 218. Specifically, the Parametric court found that language in a press release
warning that revenues would be impacted by “the level of future orders, market acceptance for
the company’s new [product] . . . ,weakness in the Asian economies, as well as the company’s
ability to continue to penetrate [a market segment]” was sufficient to invoke the shelter of the
safe harbor provision. Id. at 218-19. Similarly, in In re Ibis Technology Securities Litigation,
422 F. Supp. 2d 294 (D. Mass. 2006), the court found that cautionary language “warning that

18

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 29 of 57

product demand and market acceptance risks . . . could cause actual results to differ from the
anticipated results” sufficed to trigger the protection of the safe harbor. Id. at 311.
Like the cautionary language in those cases, the specifically tailored cautionary language
accompanying the Preliminary Earnings Prediction warned investors of the particular risks that
might impact CVS Caremark’s future earnings. Plaintiffs’ boilerplate allegation that the
statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements does not apply because “the statements were
not specifically identified as ‘forward-looking statements’ when made” (Compl. ¶ 217) is both
demonstrably false and inconsistent with the law. The PSLRA’s safe harbor therefore insulates
forward-looking earnings forecasts, including the Preliminary Earnings Prediction, from claims
of securities fraud.
B.

The Preliminary Earnings Prediction Is Entitled to the Protection of the Safe
Harbor Because Plaintiffs Do Not Plead Facts Supporting a Strong Inference
That Defendants Knew That It Was False or Misleading When Made.

Although satisfying the first inlet is sufficient by itself to gain the protection of the safe
harbor,12 the Preliminary Earnings Prediction merits protection for the additional reason that
plaintiffs do not even attempt to plead facts demonstrating that Mr. Ryan had actual knowledge
that the statement was false or misleading when made.
“[D]ismissal of securities fraud claims based on forward-looking statements is warranted
if . . . the plaintiff fails to plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the
defendant made the statements with actual knowledge that they were false or misleading.” Ibis
Tech., 422 F. Supp. 2d at 311 (emphasis on original). “‘Actual knowledge’ is a higher level of
scienter than the ‘recklessness’ required by the pleading standards of the PSLRA.” In re Sun
12

See Slayton v. Am. Express Co., 604 F.3d 758, 766 (2d Cir. 2010) (“The safe harbor is written in the
disjunctive; that is, a defendant is not liable if the forward-looking statement is identified and accompanied by
meaningful cautionary language . . . or the plaintiff fails to prove that it was made with actual knowledge that it was
false or misleading.”) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).

Healthcare Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., 181 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1289 (D.N.M. 2002) (citations
omitted).
The Complaint does not contain a single particularized factual allegation supporting an
inference that Mr. Ryan or the Company knew the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was false
when made. In fact, the allegations in the Complaint support the contrary inference—that Mr.
Ryan had a reasonable basis for his August 4 statements. First, on the August Call, Mr. Ryan
explained in detail the basis for his prediction. (See Compl. ¶ 159 (Mr. Ryan discussed new
contract wins and noted that the Company’s 2010 retention rate was 96%, slightly higher than in
2009); Compl. ¶¶ 159, 163 (Mr. Ryan acknowledged the Coventry and Chrysler contract losses);
Compl. ¶ 164 (Mr. Ryan discussed the impact of the CMS Spread Regulation).) Second, on the
November Call, Mr. Ryan provided an even more detailed explanation of why the predicted
growth had not transpired. (See Compl. ¶ 182 (Mr. Ryan noted that, “since the [August 4] call,”
the Company lost more contracts than expected (including the State of New Jersey contract) and
lost the Med-D LIS lives in 15 regions.”) (emphasis added).)
These facts do not support any inference—let alone a strong inference—that Mr. Ryan
knew the Preliminary Earnings Prediction to be false when made. Plaintiffs do not allege
relevant, non-conclusory facts suggesting that Mr. Ryan knew, on August 4, that the Company
would lose the New Jersey contract or the Med-D LIS lives. Nor do any of plaintiffs’
confidential witnesses address Mr. Ryan’s state of mind in August 2009. The only confidential
witness allegedly employed by the Company at the time of the Preliminary Earnings Prediction
was an employee at the Company’s Nashville, Tennessee call center, whose knowledge appears
to be limited to alleged problems with the computer system at that call center. (Compl. ¶ 33.)

20

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 31 of 57

At best, plaintiffs offer conclusory allegations, made with the benefit of hindsight, that
Mr. Ryan should have known that contracts were in jeopardy and that 13 to 15% earnings growth
was therefore unlikely. Such allegations, however, even if credited, are insufficient to ascribe
actual knowledge of falsity to Mr. Ryan or the Company. See Parametric, 300 F. Supp. 2d at
219 (finding forward-looking statement merited protection of safe harbor where “[t]he facts
pleaded about what [defendant] or other insiders knew are too general to permit an inference—
even a merely reasonable one—that [defendant] had actual knowledge that his statement . . . was
either false or misleading”); see also In re Avon Prods., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 05 Civ.
6803(LAK)(MHD), 2009 WL 848017, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2009).
Avon Products is instructive. Plaintiffs there challenged several forward-looking
statements on the basis that the makers of the statements had actual knowledge of their falsity.
Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that defendants’ public statements failed to refer to the alleged
unhappiness of Chinese retailers and the impact that unhappiness would have on the defendant
company’s performance. Id. at *3. Those allegations of unhappiness were similar in nature to
plaintiffs’ vague and unsupported allegations concerning purported service issues at CVS
Caremark. The Avon Products court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and noted “the
absence of specifics in the complaint regarding the scope of retailer ‘unhappiness.’” Id. at *19.
The court also listed plausible reasons supporting an inference that defendants’ did not have
actual knowledge of falsity. Id. That straightforward logic compels the same outcome here.
Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to establish that Mr. Ryan knew the Preliminary
Earnings Prediction was false or misleading when made. Indeed, the facts in the Complaint
support precisely the opposite inference.

In Scritchfield, this Court itself held that a substantially similar earnings projection to the
Preliminary Earnings Prediction was a forward-looking statement protected by the PSLRA’s safe
harbor. 274 F. Supp. 2d at 187. There, the defendant (who was the CFO of the company in
question) predicted “$15 million in revenues by the end of 2000.” Scritchfield, 274 F. Supp. 2d
at 187. This Court deemed that prediction a forward-looking statement and, accordingly, held
that it was inactionable. Id. The fact that the Preliminary Earnings Prediction is, in all material
respects, indistinguishable from the statement at issue in Scritchfield compels the same
conclusion here.
II.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE
REMAINING PURPORTEDLY ACTIONABLE STATEMENTS ALLEGED IN
THE COMPLAINT
The Complaint’s remaining alleged misstatements are equally inactionable. In particular,

the Complaint fails to state a claim because (i) plaintiffs have not adequately pled loss causation
and (ii) the vast majority of these supposed false or misleading statements are inactionable.13
A.

Plaintiffs’ Remaining Allegations Fail To Allege Loss Causation.

Because none of the remaining alleged misstatements or omissions was disclosed for the
first time on the November Call, plaintiffs have not adequately pled loss causation as to those
statements.
Loss causation is the “causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the
loss.” Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 342 (2005). In order to plead this connection,
plaintiffs must allege that a “misstatement or omission concealed something from the market that,
when disclosed, negatively affected the value of the security.” Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co.,

13

And as explained below (infra Point III), all of the alleged misstatements—including the Preliminary
Earnings Prediction—must be dismissed for the additional, independent reason that they do not allege facts raising a
strong inference of scienter.

396 F.3d 161, 173 (2d Cir. 2005); see also In re Dell Inc., Sec. Litig., 591 F. Supp. 2d 877, 907
(W.D. Tex. 2008) (plaintiffs must allege that market reacted negatively to a corrective disclosure,
“which revealed the falsity of [defendant company’s] previous representations”). This
requirement ensures that securities fraud actions are not used “to provide investors with broad
insurance against market losses,” but rather “to protect against those economic losses that
misrepresentations actually cause.” Dura, 544 U.S. at 345.
Mere confirmatory disclosures cannot, as a matter of law, cause a change in stock price;
the disclosure must be corrective in nature. See Greenberg v. Crossroads Sys., 364 F.3d 657,
670 (5th Cir. 2004); Magruder v. Halliburton Co., Civil Action No. 3:05-CV-1156-M, 2009 WL
854656, at *11 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2009) (“[T]he revelation of confirmatory information, or
information already known to the market, cannot constitute a corrective disclosure.”); In re
Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 399 F. Supp. 2d 261, 266 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (loss causation does
not arise out of disclosures that had “a negative effect on stock prices, but not a corrective
effect”).
The Complaint alleges only one purported corrective disclosure event: the November
Call.14 (Compl. ¶ 179 (“On November 5, 2009, the truth about CVS Caremark’s PBM business
was finally revealed during a conference call with investors and analysts.”).) Likewise, plaintiffs
seek to recover for only a single purported injury: the stock decline on November 5, 2009.
(Compl. ¶ 212 (“As a direct result of Defendants’ November 5, 2009 disclosures, CVS
Caremark’s stock price dropped 20 percent.”).) The only alleged misstatement or omission
during the alleged class period that was addressed on the November Call—and thus the only
14

And, as emphasized above in Point I, Defendants did not actually correct anything on the November Call
for the simple reason that there was nothing to correct. Rather, Mr. Ryan explained that, due to unforeseen
intervening events, the 2010 consolidated earnings growth rate he anticipated in August would not materialize.

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

statement for which plaintiffs could plausibly have alleged loss causation—is the Preliminary
Earnings Prediction, which is a forward-looking statement protected by the PSLRA’s safe harbor.
See supra Point I.
The remaining alleged misstatements and omissions were either not addressed on the
November Call, were already known to the market, or both. The Complaint alleges that
Defendants first disclosed to the market on November 5 “the magnitude of the lost business,
including the loss of the New Jersey account, and the true impact on the Company’s earnings.”
(Compl. ¶ 183.) The Complaint itself, however, reflects that all of this information was public
weeks or even months earlier:
• The Company confirmed the loss of the Coventry business on May 5, 2009. (Compl.
¶ 141.)
• The Company confirmed the loss of the Chrysler business on the August Call.
(Compl. ¶ 163.)
• On the August Call, the Company also disclosed the impact on earnings of the CMS
Spread Regulation. (Compl. ¶ 152.)
• The Company’s loss of the New Jersey business was known to the market as early as
August 11, 2009.15 (See Ex. 12, August 11, 2009 NorthJersey.com article.)
• The Company announced, in a mid-quarter press release on October 2, 2009, the loss
of the Med-D LIS lives and its impact on earnings. (Compl. ¶ 174.)

15

In view of the fact that the loss of the New Jersey business after the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was
reported in the public press, plaintiffs do not contend that the market first learned about the loss of that business in
the November Call. Instead, they allege that CVS Caremark did not itself disclose the loss of the New Jersey
contract until November 5. (See Compl. ¶¶ 90, 203.) However, Company policy regarding contract disclosures was
not to “provide information regarding contractual wins and losses between [quarterly earnings] calls.” (Ex. 4, Q1.08
Earnings Call Tr. at 2.) Indeed, and as plaintiffs’ allegations show, at the end of each quarter, the Company
disclosed certain of the major contracts that it had lost during that quarter and the aggregate impact of those losses.
(See Compl. ¶ 75 (Coventry loss discussed on May 5, 2009); ¶ 163 (Chrysler loss discussed on August 4, 2009); ¶
183 (New Jersey loss discussed on November 5, 2009).) The fact that CVS Caremark did not confirm the loss of the
New Jersey contract until its November 5 call is entirely consistent with its stated policy. In any event, as explained
in the text, how the market learned is irrelevant to the loss causation analysis—which is focused on the state of the
market’s awareness of relevant facts at points in time, not the precise means by which the market came to know
those facts.

Insofar as statements on the November Call addressed these issues, they merely confirmed
information that was previously known to the market and cannot provide the requisite connection
between a prior alleged misstatement and the decline in value of plaintiffs’ stock.
The Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Catogas v. Cyberonics, Inc. is right on point. No. 0720787, 2008 WL 4158923 (5th Cir. Sept. 8, 2008). Plaintiffs there claimed that an August 2006
press release was “the first time that the market learned the full ramifications of the [stock
options] backdating and repricing scheme.” Id. at 315, 2008 WL 4158923 at *4. However, a
July 2006 investment-analyst report along with Cyberonics’ June 2006 8-K had previously
revealed the very same potential problems with the company’s stock option accounting as well as
the existence of an SEC investigation, subpoenas from the United States Attorney, and the
company’s own internal investigation. Id. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district
court’s dismissal of the complaint on loss causation grounds, holding that, although plaintiffs had
alleged that the August 2006 announcement negatively impacted Cyberonics’ stock price, “such
news did not reveal anything regarding the accounting of options that had not already been
disclosed to the investing public.”16 Id.; see also Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund,
Inc. v. Halliburton Co., Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-1152-M, 2008 WL 4791492, at *2 (N.D. Tex.

Faced with the fact that investors knew all of this information before November 5, plaintiffs contend that
Defendants had not yet disclosed the “magnitude of the lost business.” (Compl. ¶ 183.) Such a theory, however,
amounts to nothing more than a failure to aggregate previously disclosed information, which cannot constitute
securities fraud. Cf. Spiegel v. Tenfold Corp., 192 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1265-1266 (D. Utah 2002) (“The inference
from . . . a pattern of disclosure is not that the individual Defendants knowingly misled investors, but rather that
Defendants attempted to inform investors of the problems as they arose.”).

things, the information allegedly withheld from plaintiffs was “already available in the
marketplace”).
Plaintiffs fare no better with their allegations that pervasive customer service issues in the
PBM business were driving clients away from CVS Caremark and that Defendants had
concealed this until the November Call.17 (See e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 10, 98, 184, 210.) In seeking to
describe this as a corrective disclosure event, they rely on a single statement from Mr. Ryan
made on November 5—that “some service issues” impacted the loss of the Coventry contract.
(Compl. ¶ 184.) As explained above, however, the Company had disclosed the loss of the
Coventry contract six months before and had discussed the financial impact of that loss in more
than one conference call before November. (Compl. ¶¶ 141, 150, 159.) Moreover, plaintiffs, in
an effort to imply that Mr. Ryan’s comment about Coventry service issues was a corrective
disclosure of some earlier fraud, attempt to manufacture a link between Mr. Ryan’s statement
about service issues with Coventry and other aspects of the Company’s PBM business. But the
Company did not suggest on the November Call that service issues had anything to do with the
New Jersey contract loss or any of the other events since August that led to the revision of the
Preliminary Earnings Prediction. Mr. Ryan’s limited statement with respect to the Coventry
contract cannot be said to have provided investors with enough information to conclude that
systemic service issues existed, let alone that they caused the Company to lose PBM business
generally or the Chrysler and New Jersey contracts specifically. Indeed, as Mr. Ryan explained
on the November 5 Call, the majority of major clients who terminated did so for reasons other
than service. (Ex. 7, Nov. 5 Tr. at 18.)
17

Plaintiffs similarly allege in an entirely conclusory fashion that Mr. McLure’s retirement was a “guise”
for his firing. (Compl. ¶ 10, 90, 108, 190.) Plaintiffs cannot, however, contend that the announcement of Mr.
McLure’s departure constitutes a disclosure of some actionable misstatement or omission. Plaintiffs do not contend,
for example, that the announcement of Mr. McLure’s retirement had not been disclosed sufficiently promptly.

Even If Plaintiffs Had Alleged Loss Causation as to the Remaining
Allegations, the Vast Majority of the Supposedly False or Misleading
Statements They Identify Are Not Actionable.

Even if plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged loss causation as to the statements in the
Complaint other than the Preliminary Earnings Prediction (which is protected under the
PSLRA’s safe harbor), the vast majority of these allegedly false or misleading statements are not
actionable under the securities laws. In particular, the law is clear that plaintiffs cannot survive a
motion to dismiss by alleging that defendants needed to disclose contract losses before they
happened or by characterizing generalized optimistic statements about its business—classic
inactionable puffery—as alleged misstatements.
1.

Plaintiffs’ theory that Defendants failed to disclose potential contract
losses fails as a matter of law.

The Complaint is replete with allegations that Defendants failed to disclose contract
losses that had not yet occurred. For instance, plaintiffs allege that Mr. Ryan’s statements on a
February 19, 2009 conference call “were materially false or misleading” because they “failed to
disclose that CVS Caremark’s 2010 business opportunities were to be offset by a number of
substantial contract non-renewals, including Coventry, Chrysler, and New Jersey.” (Compl.
¶ 128 (emphasis added).) Elsewhere in the Complaint, plaintiffs admit that CVS Caremark lost
the Coventry contract in April 2009 (Compl. ¶ 141), the Chrysler contract in July 2009 (Compl.
¶ 163), and the New Jersey contract in August 2009 (Compl. ¶ 99). A fortiori, it cannot be true
that any Defendant, including Mr. Ryan, knew in February 2009 that these contracts were lost.
At most, therefore, plaintiffs allege that Defendants should have known that contract losses were
likely to occur.

There is no duty to disclose an outcome that is merely “likely,” as opposed to
“substantially certain.”18 See, e.g., In re Citigroup, Inc. Sec. Litig., 330 F. Supp. 2d 367, 377
(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (no obligation to disclose potential litigation arising from purportedly improper
activities that was not “substantially certain to occur”), aff’d sub nom. Albert Fadem Trust v.
Citigroup, Inc., 165 F. App’x 928, 2006 WL 276611 (2d Cir. 2006); In re Ford Motor Co. Sec.
Litig., 184 F. Supp. 2d 626, 633 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (nondisclosure of mass recall not actionable
because “[c]ompanies are under no duty to disclose predictions that are not substantially certain

Civil Action No. 05-11934-DPW, 2010 WL 1704043, at *15 (D. Mass. Apr. 27, 2010) (“[A]
company need not reveal every piece of information.”) (citation omitted).
The logic of this rule is clear. If companies were required to disclose to investors the
vicissitudes of contract negotiations, the market would be flooded with contingent, hypothetical
information. The ensuing information overload “could easily result in misleading the public
more than not reporting.” In re Medimmune, Inc., Sec. Litig., 873 F. Supp. 953, 966 (D. Md.
1995). Moreover, disclosure of ongoing contract negotiations would imperil the negotiations and
diminish any competitive advantage the company may have had, which would redound directly
to the detriment of shareholders.

18

This rule holds true even when a potential outcome is fundamental to a company’s existence. See, e.g.,
Glazer v. Formica Corp., 964 F.2d 149, 157 (2d Cir. 1992) (upholding dismissal of securities fraud suit because
there was no duty to disclose a potential merger before the agreement was finalized); Chien v. Skystar Bio Pharm.

Generalized statements regarding the Company’s strategic business
model, sales outlook, and “success” of the merger are inactionable
corporate puffery.

Although the Complaint is vague as to precisely which of Defendants’ statements are
alleged to be fraudulent,19 plaintiffs appear to focus on optimistic statements regarding CVS
Caremark’s (i) post-merger business model and strategy,20 (ii) Maintenance Choice product,21
and (iii) 2010 PBM sales outlook.22 It is well settled that such “vague, or loosely optimistic

This Court has endorsed a “contextual approach to assessing the applicability of the

clear that the puffery defense applies in this case.

hyperbole” applies with equal force to the statements plaintiffs allege to be fraudulent here.23 51
F. Supp. 2d at 20. For instance, plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ positive statements about the
Company’s post-Merger business strategy were actionable false or misleading statements. (See,
e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 134, 154.) Courts have repeatedly held that similar generalized statements are
not actionable. See Lasker v. New York State Elec. & Gas Corp., 85 F.3d 55, 59 (2d Cir. 1996)
(defendant’s statement that “business strategies [would] lead to continued prosperity” constituted
puffery); In re Newell Rubbermaid Sec. Litig., No. 99 C 6853, 2000 WL 1705279 at *7 (N.D. Ill.
Nov. 14, 2000) (statements that merger “would create synergies, a ‘stronger combined presence,’
‘broader acquisition opportunities,’ and a better ability to serve Europe” deemed puffery).
Evaluating statements analogous to the allegedly false or misleading statements listed
above, courts in the First Circuit have upheld the use of the puffery defense. For instance, in
Simon v. Am. Power Conversion Corp., 945 F. Supp. 416, 428 (D.R.I. 1996), the court assessed
the defense against statements including “we are gaining market share, we are gaining
momentum, and our revenues are strong” and “1995 [is going] to be a busy year.” The court not
only held that such statements are not actionable; it noted that “the market could have expected
nothing less from a CEO, i.e. predictions of . . . improvements and a busy year.” Id. at 429.
Second, plaintiffs point to statements that do no more than “evince subjective beliefs or
opinions.” Scritchfield, 274 F. Supp. 2d at 174 (discussing In re Peritus Software Services, Inc.

securities fraud suit, Judge Young determined that the phrases “unprecedented market demand”
and “we . . . are extremely proud of our success and our focus on near and long term
opportunities” were “mere corporate puffery.” Peritus, 52 F. Supp. 2d at 220 (citing Shaw v.
Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Courts have demonstrated a
willingness to find immaterial as a matter of law a certain kind of rosy affirmation commonly
heard from corporate managers and numbingly familiar to the marketplace.”), superseded on
other grounds by statute, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)-(2)). Other courts have reached the same
outcome with respect to similarly subjective statements. Just months ago, the District of
Massachusetts upheld a puffery defense with respect to the statement “I am extremely pleased
with this record revenue performance, particularly in today’s challenging environment.” Kenney
v. State St. Corp., Civil Action No. 09-CV-10750-PBS, 2010 WL 938333, at *9 (D. Mass. Mar.
15, 2010).
Many of Defendants’ statements similarly expressed general, subjective pleasure at an
element of the Company’s performance. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 141 (“We see plenty of new
business opportunities for 2010 and we’re very pleased with the early results of the season.”);
Compl. ¶ 142 (“[W]e’re really pleased with the strong adoption of our groundbreaking
Maintenance Choice offering.”).) Relatedly, Defendants’ statements touting the success of the
merger and the ability of the integrated model to generate business are no more than subjective,
optimistic views on the Company’s strategic position.24 See NPS, LLC v. Ambac Assurance

Plaintiffs make a number of blanket allegations about the Company’s integrated business model that amount to
nothing more than hindsight critiques of the merger and of management decisions made after the merger. (See, e.g.,
Compl. ¶ 5 (“In reality, CVS Caremark’s integration was a failure.”).) “It is well-established in federal case law that
a securities fraud complaint that . . . states nothing more than a claim of corporate mismanagement . . . is not

Like plaintiffs’ myriad allegations concerning contracts that had not yet been lost,
plaintiffs’ repeated reproduction in the Complaint of Defendants’ generally optimistic statements

III.

THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO PLEAD A STRONG INFERENCE OF SCIENTER
AS TO ANY OF PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS
Even if the Complaint could articulate an actionable misstatement or omission, it still

must be dismissed in its entirety because it does not allege with particularity facts that give rise
to a strong inference of scienter that is “cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing
inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.,
551 U.S. 308, 314 (2007). In assessing claims of scienter, a court must weigh “not only
inferences urged by the plaintiff . . . but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the
facts alleged.” Id.; In re Biogen IDEC, Inc. Sec. Litig., Civil Action No. 05-10400-WGY, 2008
WL 4810045, at *5 (D. Mass. Oct. 25, 2009).
While the First Circuit has rejected any “rigid formula” for pleading scienter, In re
Cabletron Sys., Inc., 311 F.3d 11, 38 (1st Cir. 2002), plaintiffs must show that defendants acted

(continued…)
462, 479 (1977) (“By enacting § 10(b), Congress “did not seek to regulate transactions which constitute no more

with “either conscious intent to defraud or ‘a high degree of recklessness.’” ACA Fin. Guar.
Corp. v. Advest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 58 (1st Cir. 2008). The definition of recklessness is
decidedly strict and “comes closer to being a lesser form of intent than merely a greater degree of
ordinary negligence.” Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 199 (1st Cir. 1999); see id.
at 198 (adopting a definition of recklessness “involving not merely simple, or even inexcusable,
negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care”). The Complaint’s
indirect, circumstantial allegations—taken either separately or together—fail to raise the strong
inference of scienter necessary to support a claim for securities fraud.
A.

Plaintiffs’ Allegations Regarding Insider Stock Sales Fail To Give Rise to a
Strong Inference of Scienter.

The Complaint alleges that Messrs. Rickard, McLure, and Ryan made stock sales during
the alleged class period that were “suspicious.” (Compl. ¶ 109.) Even if the Individual
Defendants’ trades were suspicious—which they are not—allegations of insider trading do not,
in and of themselves, establish scienter. Miss. Pub. Employees Ret. Sys. v. Boston Sci. Corp.,
523 F.3d 75, 92 (1st Cir. 2008); Greebel, 194 F.3d at 197. In any event, plaintiffs fail to show
that Defendants’ trades were unusual and made in either suspicious amounts or at suspicious
times; in fact, the circumstances of Defendants’ trades preclude any inference of scienter at all.
1.

Messrs. Rickard and McLure traded pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, which
negate the inference of scienter.

As plaintiffs acknowledge, Mr. Rickard’s and Mr. McLure’s trades during the alleged
class period were all made pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plans. (Compl. ¶ 205.) A 10b5-1 trading
plan is a contract between a company executive and a broker that contains detailed instructions
to sell specified amounts of securities on particular dates or at specified prices. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(A); see also City of Roseville Employees’ Ret. Sys. v. Horizon Lines, Inc.,
686 F. Supp. 2d 404, 425 (D. Del. 2009) (“Defendants made sales at regular monthly intervals as

specified by their Rule 10b5-1 plans. Accordingly, the sales do not marginally increase the
likelihood that defendants make knowingly false or misleading statements out of a desire for
personal financial gain.”) (internal quotations omitted). Mr. Rickard’s 10b5-1 trading plan,
entered into on March 19, 2009, contemplated two trades: the exercise of 251,250 stock options
on August 17, 2009, followed by the exercise of 80,000 stock options on December 14, 2009.
(Ex. 9, Rickard 10b5-1 Trading Plan at 2.) As the plan lays out, these options were “[s]ubject to
[t]rading [w]indows” and the first possible trade date under the Plan was August 17, 2009. (Id.
at 1.) Mr. McLure’s trading plan, entered into on June 19, 2009, set up the exercise of 600,000
stock options in increments of 100,000 per month to be exercised on the first available trading
day of each month. (Ex. 10, McLure 10b5-1 Trading Plan at Exhibit B.) The fact of a 10b5-1
plan alone “rebuts an inference of scienter and supports the reasonable inference that stock sales
were pre-scheduled and not suspicious.”25 Stiegele ex. rel. Viisage Tech. v. Bailey, No. 0510677-MLW, 2007 WL 4197496, at *13 (D. Mass. Aug. 23, 2007). Moreover, additional
contextual information further undermines any inference of scienter based on the stock sales.
Rickard. Mr. Rickard announced in February 2009 that he would be retiring from CVS
Caremark at the end of the year. (See Ex. 5, transcript of the CVS Caremark fourth-quarter 2008
earnings conference call at 6.) Under well-established law, this fact negates plaintiffs’ allegation
that his stock sales were suspicious. It “is not unusual for individuals leaving a company . . . to
sell shares.” Greebel, 194 F.3d at 206 (pointing out that retiring individuals often have a limited
period of time to exercise stock options); Wietschner v. Monterey Pasta Co. 294 F. Supp. 2d
1102, 1116 (N.D. Cal. 2003) (finding stock sales failed to establish scienter given defendant’s
25

Contrary to plaintiffs’ conclusory assertions, the fact that Mr. Rickard and Mr. McLure entered into these
trading plans during the alleged class period is not, in and of itself, suspicious. In re Int’l Rectifier Corp. Sec. Litig.,
No. CV 07-02544-JFW (VBKx), 2008 WL 4555794, at *19 (C.D. Cal. May 23, 2008).

35

pending retirement). Moreover, Mr. Rickard’s 10b5-1 plan included two trades, one of which
took place after plaintiffs’ alleged November 5 disclosure date and, therefore, after the alleged
class period. It defies common sense that Mr. Rickard would have waited until after the alleged
fraud was disclosed to sell Company shares. In any event, Mr. Rickard’s sales constituted only
22% of his holdings (with only 17% sold during the alleged class period), further negating any
inference of scienter. See Wietschner, 294 F. Supp. 2d at 1116-17 (trading not suspicious where
defendant sold 37% of his holdings, including sales outside of the class period, in connection
with planned retirement).
McLure. Allegations pertaining to Mr. McLure’s trading are wholly irrelevant because
plaintiffs have not alleged that McLure made a single false or misleading statement.26 New
Jersey Carpenters Pension & Annuity Funds v. Biogen IDEC Inc., 537 F.3d 35, 56 (1st Cir. 2008)
(finding allegations of insider trading insufficient to establish scienter where the insider “made
none of the statements alleged to be misleading, and there is no specific allegation that [he] was
any more knowledgeable than any of the other individual defendants”); City of Dearborn Heights
Act 345 Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. Waters Corp., CA No. 1:08-11889-JTL, 2010 WL 1221402, at
*11 (D. Mass. Mar. 25, 2010) (disregarding allegations with respect to seven alleged insiders

26

The First Circuit recognizes “a very limited version of the group pleading doctrine for securities
fraud.” Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 40 (acknowledging “great debate” as to whether the doctrine survives the enactment
of the PSLRA, but declining to decide either way). Even if the doctrine survives, only “group-published documents
such as annual reports filed with the … SEC” fall under its scope. See Rosen v. Textron, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 308,
328 n. 14 (D.R.I. 2004). All but two of the alleged misstatements were made during earnings calls, or other, similar
presentations where the speaker is readily apparent; such statements are not “group-published” and therefore cannot
be attributed to the other Defendants. See Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 41 n. 16. With respect to Mr. McLure, plaintiffs
do not allege that he made a single misleading or omissive statement; as a result, the securities fraud claim against
him cannot stand. See Rosen, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 328 (dismissing claim against defendant where defendant never
signed any SEC filings and plaintiffs did not attribute any actionable misstatements to him).

accused of selling stock because none were responsible for making any alleged misstatements to
investors).27
2.

Mr. Ryan’s single stock sale was not suspicious.

Plaintiffs have similarly failed to plead facts establishing that Mr. Ryan’s single trade
supports an inference of scienter.
First, while plaintiffs emphasize the absolute dollar value size of Mr. Ryan’s sale (Compl.
¶¶ 107, 206), they ignore that Mr. Ryan sold only 5.4% of his total holdings28—an amount that,
as a matter of law, does not support a strong inference of scienter. See Acito v. Imcera Group,
Inc., 47 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1995) (noting that a sale of only 11% of holdings, absent other
allegations, suggested that the trading was not unusual); In re Gildan Activewear, Inc. Sec. Litig.,
636 F. Supp. 2d 261, 270 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding that “total sales amounting to a relatively low
percentage of an insider’s percentage of stock holdings militate against an inference of scienter”
where defendants sold 22.5% and 4.9% of holdings); In re Glenayre Tech. Inc. Sec. Litig., No.
96 CIV. 8252(HB), 1998 WL 915907, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1998) (finding that a sale of only
5% of holdings did not raise an inference of scienter).
Second, plaintiffs fail to plead that Mr. Ryan’s sale was inconsistent with his prior trading
history, let alone “well beyond [his] normal patterns of trading.” Greebel, 194 F.3d at 198; see

27

Even considering Mr. McLure’s sales arguendo, plaintiffs do not plead facts that give rise to a strong
inference of scienter. Mr. McLure entered into his trading plan on June 19, 2009, and scheduled the sale of 600,000
shares (in increments of 100,000 on the first eligible trading day of each month beginning on July 19, 2009). (See
Ex. 10, McLure 10b5-1 Trading Plan at Exhibit B.) Had Mr. McLure known of the contract losses plaintiffs allege
Defendants concealed, it would have defied logic to schedule future sales at times he knew would likely follow the
disclosure of those losses.
28

Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Ryan sold “22% of his shares personally held during the Class Period, and over
7 percent of his total holdings, including vested options.” (Compl. ¶ 109.) However, the Company’s 2009
Definitive Proxy Statement, filed March 24, 2009 on SEC Schedule 14A, reflects that Mr. Ryan owned 7,398,279
shares. The 400,000 shares that Mr. Ryan sold on August 7, 2009 constitute 5.4% of that total ownership. (See
Ex. 2, CVS Caremark 2009 Definitive Proxy Statement at 12.)

B.

The Complaint’s Remaining Allegations Fail To Allege That Defendants
Acted with a High Degree of Recklessness.

Plaintiffs rely on a confusing and contradictory set of irrelevant allegations from
confidential witnesses in an attempt to establish that the Defendants were reckless in not
knowing that (1) certain contracts were lost before the Company disclosed these losses; (2)
contracts were being lost due to pervasive service and integration issues; (3) the CMS Spread
Regulation would lead to material losses in 2010; and (4) the Maintenance Choice offering was
not driving renewals or gaining new contracts. As explained in Sections II.A and II.B, supra,
each of these allegations fails because plaintiffs have not pled loss causation or that the
allegations are anything more than inactionable puffery. In addition, none of these allegations
adequately pleads scienter.30
1.

The statements in the Complaint attributed to confidential witnesses
do not create a strong inference of scienter.

In evaluating statements by confidential sources, the court will consider the “level of
detail provided by the confidential sources, the corroborative nature of the other facts alleged
(including from other sources), the coherence and plausibility of the allegations, the number of
sources, the reliability of the sources, and similar indicia.” Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 29-30.

29

In any event, even if Mr. Ryan’s trade is deemed to be unusual—which it should not be—the unusual
sales of only one defendant cannot give rise to a strong inference of scienter. See N.J. Carpenters, 537 F.3d at 56.
30

For the same reasons that plaintiffs fail to allege that Mr. Ryan gave his Preliminary Earnings Prediction
with actual knowledge that it was false (see supra Section I.B), plaintiffs similarly fail to adequately allege that Mr.
Ryan did so with the “high degree of recklessness” required to plead a strong inference of scienter. See ACA Fin.,
512 F.3d at 58.

Six of plaintiffs’ thirteen confidential witnesses—CW1, CW2, CW8, CW11, CW12 and
CW13—did not even work for the Company during the alleged class period. (See Compl. ¶ 33.)
And CW5 is alleged to have been employed at the Company only during the first month of the
alleged class period (November 2008). Id. As both a practical matter and as a matter of law,
none of these confidential witnesses could provide information, based on personal knowledge,
that is probative of the Defendants’ state of mind at the time of any of the allegedly false or
misleading statements. Plaintiffs in California Public Employees’ Retirement System v. Chubb
Corp. alleged, based on information provided by a former vice president of the company, that
quarterly meetings were usually held two weeks after the close of each quarter during which
certain executives were present and quarterly earnings were discussed. 394 F.3d 126, 154 (3d
Cir. 2004). The Third Circuit rejected plaintiffs’ claims that there must have been a meeting two
weeks after the end of the quarter in question and that defendants must have known about the
quarterly earnings for that quarter, because the former vice president was not alleged to be
employed at the time of these alleged events. See id.; In re Rackable Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. C
09-0222 CW, 2010 WL 199703, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2010) (finding it unlikely that four of
the confidential witnesses had personal knowledge of defendants’ relevant state of mind when
none was employed at company during class period); Malin v. XL Capital Ltd., 499 F. Supp. 2d
117, 141 (D. Conn. 2007) (finding information collected from confidential witnesses—“although
substantial in amount”—inadequate to support inference of scienter where “the bulk of the
information relayed by the [confidential witnesses] relates to the time prior to the start of the
Class Period”), aff’d, 312 F. App’x 400, 2009 WL 481897 (2d Cir. 2009).
Even those confidential witnesses alleged to be employed by the Company during the

CW10—allegedly employed as a Client Audit Analyst in the Scottsdale, Arizona office from
2007 to April 2009—offers irrelevant assertions regarding problems with the Company’s billing
process, yet does not appear to have worked on any of the contracts discussed in the Complaint
and alleges nothing with respect to how any Defendant knew about such problems. (Compl.
¶¶ 33, 92.) Likewise, CW7—an Audit Department Team Leader from 1994 to March 2009—
offers purported information about a computer system called “Reflections,” yet fails to link
anything produced through Reflections with contract losses or the knowledge of any Defendant.
(Compl. ¶¶ 33, 78.)
No confidential witness relied on in the Complaint is alleged to have ever met any of the
Individual Defendants. They are also not alleged to have any knowledge of the forecasting
process or how the Company put together its projected earnings for the quarterly earnings
announcements and conference calls. Moreover, only one of the confidential witnesses offers
any specific dates on which a report was issued or a meeting took place (Compl.¶ 85), and this
date falls outside of the alleged class period; the remainder of the confidential witnesses fail to
offer any particular details regarding when information allegedly became known. See N.J.
Carpenters, 537 F.3d at 52-53 (dismissing information from confidential witnesses where several
of the witnesses did not allege when certain facts became known). Such defects render
ineffective the allegations purportedly supported by confidential witness statements. See Chubb
Corp., 394 F.3d at 155 (noting that the “sheer volume of confidential sources cited cannot
compensate for . . . inadequacies” including the lack of factual particularity).
2.

Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific contract-related information that
would have put Defendants on notice that their statements were false
or misleading.

Plaintiffs’ generalized claims that Defendants should have known about contract losses
from weekly Sales Pipeline Reports and monthly and quarterly meetings and phone calls (see,
40

Case 1:09-cv-00554-S-DLM Document 34

Filed 07/02/10 Page 51 of 57

e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 65, 68, 69) fail because the Complaint does not identify the specific information
that Defendants purportedly learned that would have put them on notice that their disclosures
were false or misleading. See Isham v. Perini Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 28, 35-36 (D. Mass. 2009)
(identifying as too vague and “routinely” dismissed allegations that defendants had access to
corporate documents and that they attended regular management meetings); In re Elan Corp. Sec.
Litig., 543 F. Supp. 2d 187, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (allegations “far too vague with respect to what
information was actually communicated and what conclusions any defendant actually reached”).
Moreover, plaintiffs offer no statistical or other factual support for their conclusory allegation
that contracts designated “at risk” in Sales Pipeline Reports were substantially likely to be lost
during the next selling season. (Compl. ¶ 65.)
Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to specific contracts fare no better. Plaintiffs make
contradictory allegations regarding when the Defendants purportedly became aware that the
Company was going to lose the Coventry contract. (See Compl. ¶ 76 (July 2008); Compl. ¶ 79
(August or September of 2008); Compl. ¶ 83 (October 2008).) Rather than supporting an
inference of scienter, these competing allegations support the inference that the Company did not
know that it would lose the Coventry contract prior to Coventry’s decision. With respect to the
New Jersey contract, plaintiffs concede that Defendants did not know that it had been lost until
August 5, 2009—a day after Mr. Ryan’s August statement regarding 2010 Earnings. (Compl.
¶¶ 90, 203.) Finally, with respect to the Chrysler contract, plaintiffs offer only the conclusory
and legally irrelevant allegation that, by mid-2008, Defendants knew that Chrysler was at risk for
loss.31 (See Compl. ¶ 94.)
31

Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to Chrysler are further undermined by the fact that the Company
actually retained the Chrysler business with respect to the lives that Chrysler continued to control. See infra,
Section III.B.2.

Moreover, plaintiffs’ theory of scienter as to the contract losses defies economic reason.
It is illogical that the Company, knowing it had already lost certain contracts, would devote time
and money to winning those contracts. See ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of
Chicago v. JP Morgan Chase Co., 553 F.3d 187, 203 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that, where
“[p]laintiffs’ view of the facts defied economic reason,” the facts do “not yield a reasonable
inference of fraudulent intent”) (quoting Atl. Gypsum Co. v. Lloyds Int’l Corp., 753 F. Supp.
505, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)). But plaintiffs allege that, despite knowing that the New Jersey
contract was as good as lost, CVS Caremark added additional staffing to its customer service
base for New Jersey. (See Compl. ¶ 86.) Similarly, plaintiffs’ scienter allegations are
undermined because the Complaint contains no explanation of why Defendants would conceal
information about contract losses that they knew would soon be revealed to the market. See
Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc., 25 F.3d 1124, 1130 (2d Cir. 1994) (defendants are assumed to
be acting in their own informed economic interest and it is “hard to see what benefits accrue
from a short respite from an inevitable day of reckoning”). Rather than raising a strong inference
that Defendants knew these contracts were lost, such facts indicate that the Company believed
just the opposite.
3.

Plaintiffs fail to plead facts supporting their assertion that Defendants
knew that customer service problems were causing contract losses.

Plaintiffs fail to plead facts that support their assertion that Defendants knew that
pervasive customer service problems were causing contract losses.32 First, as explained above,

32

Plaintiffs also attempt, but fail, to plead scienter based on allegations that Defendants perpetrated a
fraudulent scheme in order to conceal that the merger had failed. Such “catch-all” allegations of motive and
opportunity alone are not sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter. Rosen, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 322.
Indeed, the desire to sustain an appearance of profitability has been “consistently rejected” as an insufficient motive.
Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Dynex Capital, Inc., 531 F.3d 190, 196-97 (2d Cir. 2008); cf.
Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 39 (finding that scienter had been adequately pled where the plaintiffs alleged “more than the
usual concern by executives to improve financial results”). Rather, plaintiffs must allege that Defendants sought to

on the November Call on which plaintiffs allege “the truth was finally revealed” Defendant Ryan
mentioned service only in connection with the Coventry contract. (See Ex. 7, Nov. 5 Tr. at 9.)
Second, plaintiffs plead facts directly contradicting an inference that defendants were aware of
pervasive service issues, including (1) that, in 2009, J.D. Power and Associates recognized the
Company for excellence in customer service for the third time (Compl. ¶¶ 120, 125) and (2) that
the Company’s retention rate for the 2010 selling season was 92%. (Compl. ¶ 191; see also
Ex. 7, Nov. 5 Tr. at 4 (stating that Company also gained 125 new clients during 2009).) Third,
plaintiffs conspicuously fail to acknowledge that the Company retained its Chrysler business
with respect to active employees and non-union retirees. (Ex. 6, Aug. 4 Tr. at 3.) The Company
lost only the Chrysler unionized retirees whose coverage was spun off into a voluntary employee
benefit association (“VEBA”) operated independently by the International Union, United
Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”). (See
Compl. ¶ 163.) Therefore, plaintiffs’ claim that the Company “lost the Chrysler contract due to
long-running service-related and transparency issues” (Compl. ¶ 173) does not hold water;
Chrysler would not have renewed its contract for the lives it controlled if it had been dissatisfied
with the Company’s customer service. Plaintiffs’ efforts to create the appearance that pervasive
service problems at the Company were driving customers away are unavailing and fail to plead
any facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter.

obtain a specific benefit from the alleged fraud that would not be “either generalized to all corporate directors or
beneficial to all shareholders.” Kalnit v. Eichler, 264 F.3d 131, 142 (2d Cir. 2001); In re Stone & Webster, Inc. Sec.
Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d 102, 129 (D. Mass. 2003) (defendants must have “benefitted in some concrete personal way
from the purported fraud”).

Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the CMS Spread Regulation fail to
plead a strong inference of scienter.

Plaintiffs’ scienter allegations in connection with the CMS Spread Regulation fail
“because [CVS Caremark] disclosed that which the Complaint alleges it concealed.” In re First
Marblehead Corp. Sec. Litig., 639 F. Supp. 2d 145, 163 (D. Mass. 2009) (finding that, because
defendants had disclosed the facts and underlying risks that plaintiffs complain were concealed,
such disclosures “negate any inference of scienter”). First, Defendants did not conceal the
impact of the CMS Spread Regulation. In the Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q, which the Company
filed three months before the alleged corrective disclosure, the Company announced that the
CMS Spread Regulation would “reduce the profitability of our Medicare Part D business
beginning in 2010.” (Ex. 3, Second-Quarter 2009 10-Q at 24.) Moreover, Plaintiffs’ claim that
Defendants knew the CMS Spread Regulation would lead to material losses in 2010 but “failed
to warn investors, [and] instead falsely classified the change as a mere ‘headwind’” (Compl.
¶ 110) takes the “headwind” statement entirely out of context. At the May 15, 2009 investor
meeting at which the Company disclosed the regulatory change, Mr. Rickard expressly stated
that the full impact was still “unknown.” (Ex. 8, transcript of CVS Caremark’s May 15, 2009
annual analyst/investor meeting at 38 (“[w]hile the full details of this change are still unknown,
the net impact will be a headwind”) (emphasis added).)33 In no way does Mr. Rickard’s
statement—or any other statements by Defendants—support a strong inference that they knew of,
but concealed, the precise impact that the CMS Spread Regulation would have on the
Company’s bottom line.

33

Mr. Rickard’s use of the word “headwind” was not meant to describe the degree of impact that this
change would have, but merely to denote, among other disclosures, whether this would be a positive impact
(“tailwind”) or a negative impact (“headwind”).

Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Maintenance Choice fail to plead a
strong inference of scienter.

Plaintiffs allege that the Maintenance Choice offering was not driving renewals or
gaining new contracts. (Compl. ¶ 111.) However, the Complaint fails to provide a single factual
allegation in support of that claim, let alone facts showing that Defendants had any knowledge of
the alleged issues with Maintenance Choice.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS DO NOT STATE A CLAIM FOR CONTROL PERSON LIABILITY
Plaintiffs have failed to allege a primary violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act

and Rule 10b-5. Accordingly, as a matter of law, plaintiffs cannot recover from the Individual
Defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. See, e.g., Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,
194 F.3d 185, 207 (1st Cir. 1999) (“Because plaintiffs’ complaint does not adequately allege an
underlying violation of the securities laws, the district court was correct to dismiss the Section
20(a) claim.”) (citing Suna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997)). Therefore,
plaintiffs’ Section 20(a) “control person” claim must be dismissed as to each of the Individual
Defendants.34

34

Because plaintiffs do not allege that Mr. McLure made a single false or misleading statement, Mr.
McLure could only be found liable under a control person theory. However, the Complaint contains no
individualized allegations as to Mr. McLure’s purported control of the Company. The § 20(a) claims against him
must therefore be dismissed for this additional reason.
