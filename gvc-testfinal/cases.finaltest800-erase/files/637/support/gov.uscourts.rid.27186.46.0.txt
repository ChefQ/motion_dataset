Defendants submit this supplemental memorandum of law as directed by this Court's March
22, 2011 order in further support of their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' Complaint.' In the March 22
order, this Court requested supplemental briefing on the impact on the motion of two recent decisions:
Matrixx Initiatives, Inc, v. Siracusano, 131 S. Ct. 1309 (2011), and Hill v. Gozani, No. 10-1048,

2011 WL 924242 (Ist Cir. Mar. 18, 2011) (hereinafter Anima). As explained below, both cases

 

provide additional support for dismissal of plaintiffs' claims."
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

As set forth in Defendants' original motion papers and reply, there are numerous independent
grounds that require dismissal of the Complaint in its entirety.

First, the PSLRA's statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements protects Mr. Ryan's
Preliminary Earnings Prediction for two reasons. (See Defs." Mem. Part 1; Reply Part I.) The
Preliminary Earnings Prediction was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language and, under the
PSLRA and well-established First Circuit law, is protected for that reason alone. (Defs." Mem.
Section I.A; Reply Section I.B.) In addition, plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to allege that Mr.
Ryan had actual knowledge that the Preliminary Earnings Prediction was false or misleading when
made, as required to overcome the PSLRA's safe harbor. (Defs.' Mem. Section I.B; Reply Section
I.C.) Neither Matrixx nor Anima addresses or diminishes this well-established law, which requires
dismissal of all of plaintiffs' claims relating to the Preliminary Earnings Prediction.

Second, plaintiffs have not pled loss causation for the remainder of the alleged misstatements

and omissions in the Complaint because plaintiffs do not and cannot contend that any of these

 

' For the purposes of this supplemental memorandum of law, all defined terms shall have the same meaning as
those in Defendants' opening memorandum of law and reply memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss.

? As reflected in this Court's March 22, 2011 order, Defendants' "motion to dismiss will be automatically
reinstated (i.cent., it need not be refiled)" once plaintiffs have filed their response to this supplemental memorandum on or
before May 13, 2011.
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 5 of 15 PagelD #: 1448

statements was addressed, much less "corrected," on the November Call. (See Defs." Mem. Section
II.A; Reply Section II.A.) Each of the contract losses that underlie plaintiffs' allegations had already
been disclosed by the Company or was known publicly from news articles, analyst reports or third-
party press releases well before the November Call. For that reason, disclosure of those losses
cannot, as a matter of law, have caused the loss for which plaintiffs now seek to recover. (See Defs.'
Mem. Section II.A; Reply Section II.A.) Anima does quote the bedrock principle that undergirds this
independent basis for dismissal: that the securities laws exist "not to provide investors with broad
insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that
misrepresentations actually cause." No. 10-1048, 2011 WL 924242, at *9 (Ist Cir. Mar. 18, 2011)
(quoting Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 345 (2005)) (emphasis added). But neither
Anima nor Matrixx otherwise addresses loss causation. Neither therefore diminishes in any way this
independent ground for dismissal of all aspects of the Complaint other than the Preliminary Earnings
Prediction, which is an inactionable forward-looking statement for the reasons explained above.

Third, the vast majority of the statements are inactionable for the separate, independent
reasons that (1) the company need not disclose a risk that is merely likely, as opposed to substantially
certain, to occur, and (2) because many of the statements are inactionable corporate puffery. (See
Defs.' Mem. Section II.B; Reply Section II.B.) As explained below, both Matrixx and Anima
provide further guidance on the former of these grounds, strongly supporting this alternative basis for
dismissal of plaintiffs' claims that would require disclosure of potential contract losses before those
losses were "substantially certain" to occur. Anima in particular confirms that robust public
disclosures about the general possibility of contract losses like those made by the Company here
amply satisfy its disclosure obligations.

Fourth, all of plaintiffs' claims must fail for the further independent reason that plaintiffs
have not pled facts sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter. (See Defs." Mem. Part III;

Reply Part III.) As explained further below, the Supreme Court's analysis in Matrixx only provides
2

 
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 6 of 15 PagelD #: 1449

additional support for this conclusion. In Matrixx, the Court applied the analysis first set forth in

 

Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308 (2007), which requires dismissal unless "a
reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any
opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged." Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1324 (quoting

Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 324). In stark contrast to the allegations that were upheld in Matrixx, plaintiffs'

 

allegations of scienter here-based on insider sales and non-specific and irrelevant assertions by
anonymous witnesses who concededly had no contact with senior executives-do not satisfy this
high pleading burden.
ARGUMENT
I. PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS MUST BE DISMISSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY UNDER THE
PSLRA'S SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FOR
FAILURE TO PLEAD LOSS CAUSATION SUFFICIENTLY
As set forth in detail in Defendants' opening and reply briefs, plaintiffs' Complaint must be
dismissed in its entirety because their claims either (i) are barred by the PSLRA's safe harbor for
forward-looking statements or (ii) fail to plead loss causation. Because neither Matrixx nor Anima
addresses these grounds for dismissal, Defendants do not address them further here and respectfully
refer the Court to their opening and reply briefs. (See Defs." Mem. Part I, Section II.A; Reply Part I,
Section II.A.)
II. MATRIXX AND ANIMA CONFIRM THAT THE COMPANY HAD NO DUTY TO
DISCLOSE CONTRACT LOSSES UNLESS THEY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY
CERTAIN TO OCCUR

Both Matrixx and Anima further support dismissal of plaintiffs' claims that the Company

 

should have disclosed contracts it was allegedly "likely" to lose.' As explained in Defendants'

opening and reply briefs, it has long been clear that there is no duty to disclose an outcome that is

 

* In addition, many of the alleged misstatements in plaintiffs' Complaint are inactionable puffery and should be
dismissed on that ground alone. Because neither Matrixx nor Anima addresses that ground for dismissal, Defendants do
not address it further here and respectfully refer the Court to their opening and reply briefs. (See Defs." Mem. Section
11.B.2; Reply Section I.B.2.)
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 7 of 15 PagelD #: 1450

merely likely, as opposed to one that is substantially certain to occur. (See Defs." Mem. at 28-29 and
cases cited.) For that reason, CVS Caremark had no duty to disclose the risk of specific potential
contract losses, particularly where CVS Caremark had already disclosed the general risk of contract
losses in its public filings. Both Anima and Matrixx confirm this basic proposition of federal
securities law.

As a threshold matter, the Supreme Court explained in Matrixx that "it bears emphasis that
0x00A7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material
information." 131 S. Ct. at 1321. Or, as the First Circuit likewise clarified in Anima, `"`the mere

possession of material, nonpublic information does not create a duty to disclose." Anima, 2011 WL

 

924242 at *12 (quoting Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1999)). Rather,
"Td]isclosure is required under these provisions only when necessary `to make . . . statements made,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.'" Matrixx, 131 S. Ct.
at 1321 (quoting 17 C.F.R. 0x00A7 240.10b-5(b)).

Therefore, even if plaintiffs could plead facts sufficient to establish that the loss of any of the
contracts was material-which they have not-CVS Caremark was under no obligation to disclose
that the losses of any of these contracts were merely "likely" in view of its other public disclosures.
Specifically, CVS Caremark had already disclosed to the market: "our failure to renew or win PBM
business could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation."
(Declaration of Lawrence Portnoy, dated July 2, 2010, Ex. 1, 2008 10-K at 20.) Under those
circumstances, there was no need to disclose anything further about the risk of loss of any particular
contract.

The First Circuit's analysis in Anima directly supports this conclusion, deeming far more

 

material alleged omissions inactionable. In Anima, plaintiffs alleged that defendants promoted
improper billing practices that resulted in artificially high reimbursement rates from insurers for a

new device the company had developed. 2011 WL 924242 at *1 (1st Cir. March 18,
4
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 8 of 15 PagelD #: 1451

2011). Plaintiffs claimed that the company failed adequately to disclose the risk that insurers would
not fully reimburse for procedures using the device, and that, to the extent defendants did discuss
insurer reimbursements, such discussions were affirmative misstatements. Id. Specifically, plaintiffs
alleged that the defendant company was aware of, yet disregarded, the opinions of two successive,
internal experts regarding the significant risks of non-reimbursement, including one expert's warning
that recommending the use of these improper practices would amount to Medicare fraud. Id. at *3,
*12. Both experts allegedly resigned after the company refused to heed their warnings. Id. at *3.

The First Circuit rejected as inactionable plaintiffs' claims that the company should have
disclosed more about the risk of nonreimbursement. Id. at *15. Specifically, the Court of Appeals
made clear that a company need not disclose particular events or losses in the absence of "certainty"
or "near certainty," even if the occurrence of those events or losses could be considered material. Id.
at *14. Moreover, the court explained that "where the level of risk is unknown," the failure to
specify the precise degree of the risk is not an actionable omission. Id. at *15 (noting that a general
statement of risk "does not create liability simply because it does not disclose, at the level of detail
the plaintiffs request in retrospect, all of the factors that contribute to the risk assessment").

The Supreme Court's analysis in Matrixx-which addressed a starkly different factual

 

situation from that alleged in the Complaint-is likewise instructive. There, a pharmaceutical
company failed to disclose reports that its leading product-Zicam Cold Remedy-caused a loss of
the sense of smell, medically known as anosmia. 131 S. Ct. at 1314-15. Matrixx urged the Court to
adopt a bright-line test for determining whether plaintiffs had sufficiently pled that the company had
made material misstatements and omissions-namely, that, absent an allegation that there was a
statistically significant risk that its product caused the adverse events, the lack of disclosure was not
materially misleading. Id. at 1313-14. The Supreme Court declined to adopt such a rule, instead
affirming the continued application of the materiality standard set forth in Basic Inc. v. Levinson-

calling for an assessment of whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the undisclosed
5
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 9 of 15 PagelD #: 1452

information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available. Id. at 1321.
The Court clarified that the mere existence of reports of adverse events, without more, would not
satisfy the Basic "total mix" standard. Id. But the particular facts in Matrixx, combined with the
existence of adverse events, required disclosure in that case.

In contrast to CVS Caremark, which openly disclosed the risk of contract losses, Matrixx had
affirmatively denied any possible link between Zicam and anosmia, even though it was aware of the
adverse event reports and the evidence of a biological link between Zicam and anosmia. Specifically,
Matrixx's vice president for research and development had personally spoken to doctors who had
raised concerns about Zicam's connection with anosmia and cited studies supporting this connection.
Id. at 1314-15. That same vice president wrote a letter to one of those doctors barring him from
using Matrixx's name or the name of any of its products in a presentation that doctor made regarding
Zicam's connection to anosmia. Id. at 1315. Furthermore, product liability suits were filed against
the company and the FDA had launched an investigation in reaction to these suits. Id. Despite all of
this knowledge, the company did not disclose any risk that a possible connection to anosmia could
impact its financial results. Id. Instead, Matrixx issued a press release disclaiming any connection
between Zicam and anosmia and representing that no study had produced a single report of lost or
diminished sense of smell. Id. at 1316. In view of those statements and in the absence of any
disclosure of the risk of loss, the Court concluded that Matrixx's failure to disclose the adverse
events at issue created a reasonable expectation that discovery would lead to evidence satisfying the
materiality requirement. Id. at 1323.

The differences between the circumstances in Matrixx and those alleged here could not be
more clear. Far from denying the possibility that future contract losses could impact its results, CVS
Caremark expressly explained that there was a risk the company would not be able to win new
business on terms as favorable as it had in the past, and such a failure to renew or win PBM business

could have an adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, the actionable omission in Matrixx was of
6
Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 46 Filed 04/29/11 Page 10 of 15 PagelD #: 1453

adverse events that had actually transpired-not the mere possibility of adverse events. By contrast,
plaintiffs' allegations here pertain only to potential future losses. For these reasons, Matrixx is fully
consistent with Anima and the host of cases that preceded it (cited in Defendants' opening and reply
briefs) that make clear that CVS Caremark had no legal obligation to disclose specific potential
contract losses where the general risk of contract losses had already been disclosed.

In any case, the question of whether or not there was a duty to disclose a specific contract
loss or the risk of that loss is not dispositive. Because each of the contract losses alleged in the
Complaint had been publicly disclosed well in advance of the November Call-the only alleged
corrective disclosure event-plaintiffs have failed to allege loss causation for any of these alleged
omissions.' For that reason, even if the alleged omissions were actionable-which they are not-
they would not entitle plaintiffs to relief here.

I. THE SUPREME COURT'S ANALYSIS IN MATRIXX ONLY CONFIRMS THAT
PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO PLEAD SCIENTER SUFFICIENTLY

The Complaint's circumstantial allegations-including the statements attributed to
confidential witnesses-fail to raise the strong inference of scienter necessary to support a claim for
securities fraud. (Defs.' Mem. Part III; Reply Part III.) The Supreme Court's decision in Matrixx
further supports this independent ground for dismissal.

Matrixx confirmed and applied the Supreme Court's now well-established approach to
analyzing allegations of scienter under the PSLRA's heightened pleading standard. Quoting from its

earlier Tellabs decision, the Court explained: "This standard requires courts to take into account

 

* As explained in Defendants' opening and reply briefs, each of the contract losses described in the Complaint
had been disclosed publicly well before the November Call. (Defs." Mem. Section IA; Reply Section II.A.) Though
plaintiffs seek to make much of the fact that the Company itself (consistent with its general policy not to disclose
individual PBM contract losses mid-quarter) had not itself disclosed the loss of the New Jersey contract (Pls. Opp. at 10),
plaintiffs have failed to allege and, indeed, could not allege that the loss of the New Jersey contract was made public for
the first time on the November Call. (Defs.' Mem. at 24; Reply at 13 n.9) Months earlier, CVS Caremark's loss of the
contract was publicized in news articles-as well as a host of analysts reports-many specifically noting that the loss
would not have any material impact on projected earnings.
