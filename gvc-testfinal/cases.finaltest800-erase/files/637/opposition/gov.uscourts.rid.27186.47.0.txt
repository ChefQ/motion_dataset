PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Lead Plaintiffs respectfully submit this supplemental memorandum of law in opposition
to Defendants’ motion to dismiss as ordered by the Court’s Procedural Order, entered March 22,
2011 (“Procedural Order”) (Docket No. 45).1 The Court requested that the parties address the
Supreme Court’s recent decision in Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 1318
(2011), on the issue of materiality and scienter, and the First Circuit’s recent decision in Anima
S.G.P.R.A. v. Gozani, No. 10-1048, 2011 WL 924242 (1st Cir. Mar. 18, 2011), as to materiality
alone. Both of these cases further support denial of Defendants’ motion to dismiss.
Matrixx reaffirmed the standard for pleading materiality under Section 10(b), finding that
a plaintiff’s allegations must plausibly suggest a “substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the
omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered
the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” 131 S. Ct. at 1318 (citations omitted). The facts
of Matrixx are instructive. There, plaintiffs alleged defendants knew of evidence linking the
company’s cold medicine product to the loss of the sense of smell. Rather than disclosing this
specific adverse fact to investors, Matrixx issued boilerplate, generic risk warnings and
aggressive earnings guidance. Id. at 1315, 1323. Undertaking a contextual analysis, the
Supreme Court concluded that the complaint sufficiently pled materiality based on alleged “facts
suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of Matrixx’s leading product.” Id. at
1323 (emphasis added).

Lead Plaintiffs submit this brief further to their Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss
the Corrected Consolidated Complaint (Docket No. 36) (the “Opposition Brief” or “Opp. Br.”). Capitalized terms,
unless otherwise defined herein, have the same meaning as defined in the Opposition Brief and the Corrected
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”) (Docket No. 33). Defendants’ Memorandum of Law In
Further Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, dated April 29, 2011 (Docket No. 46), is referred to throughout
as “Defendants’ Supplemental Brief” or “Def. Supp. Br.” References to “¶__” are to the Complaint.

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 3 of 21 PageID #: 1461

Anima, issued a week before Matrixx, concluded that a company need only disclose risks
that are “near certain[]” to occur, presenting a conflict with the “substantial risk” standard
adopted by the Supreme Court in Matrixx. 2011 WL 924242, at *14. In Anima, plaintiffs
alleged that defendant NeuroMetrix concealed the risk of insurance companies not reimbursing
physicians for using the company’s neurological testing device. The First Circuit disagreed,
concluding that “a risk of non-reimbursement specifically was disclosed,” id. at 14 (emphasis in
original), and that defendants’ press release “state[d] explicitly that the ultimate resolution of the
issue is unknown and, by reasonable implications, out of its hands.” Id.
Both under the controlling “substantial risk” standard—as well as the Anima standard—
the Complaint adequately alleges materially false statements and omissions that would have
“significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information if made available.” Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at
1318. “This case arises from Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements relating to
the Merger, and, in particular, the success and profitability of the PBM business.” ¶1. Contrary
to Defendants’ repeated characterizations, the allegations are not merely limited to Defendants’
failure to disclose certain contract losses that had yet to occur or to meet forward-looking
“Preliminary Earnings Predictions.” Def. Supp. Br. at 6-7. Instead, the Complaint centers on
Defendants’ concealment of the: (i) contemporaneous failure of the merger of Caremark into
CVS; (ii) inability to integrate the two companies’ systems and personnel; (iii) inability to
provide adequate service to the Company’s customers; (iv) resulting frequent, consistent, and
repeated complaints from customers; and (v) known fact that billions of dollars in contracts had
been terminated because of the service and integration problems during the Class Period. Opp.
Br. at 12-13. Rather than disclose these materially adverse facts, Defendants made false
statements concerning the Merger, the integration process, and the Company’s future prospects,

2

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 4 of 21 PageID #: 1462

and gave investors knowingly false earnings guidance. Then, just three days later, Defendants
launched a $40 million selling spree of personally held Company shares. ¶¶106-09.2
Tellingly, while Defendants continue to promote their unfounded arguments, they do not
contest that the material reasons why the Company lost key contracts and missed its earnings
guidance—i.e., the failed integration and service issues—were known at the time Defendants
made their actionable statements but were hidden from investors. As revealed on November 5,
2009, the service and integration problems undermined the viability of CVS Caremark’s PBM
business, leading one analyst to write that Defendants’ disclosure of the truth provided
“undeniable evidence today that it has mismanaged the Caremark acquisition and destroyed
shareholder value.” ¶¶184, 193.3
ARGUMENT
I.

Matrixx And Anima Further Support Denial of Defendants’
Motion To Dismiss As It Relates To Materiality
A.

Matrixx Reaffirmed That The Complaint Adequately Pleads That
Defendants Are Liable For Materially False Statements And Omissions

Matrixx reaffirmed that, to plead materiality under Section 10(b), a plaintiff need only
allege a “‘substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed
by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made
available.’” Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1318 (quoting Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32

2

Just last week—nearly a year after Lead Plaintiffs filed the Complaint—CVS Caremark disclosed that the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has issued subpoenas related to the same course of conduct
Lead Plaintiffs allege here. See CVS Caremark Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2011 at 12.
3
The Court’s Procedural Order requested additional briefing on two specific issues: (1) “whether the
defendants had a duty to disclose the risks of losing customer contracts when, according to the defendants, those
losses were not ‘substantially certain’ to occur,” and (2) “whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts
plausibly suggesting that the defendants acted with the requisite level of scienter.” March 22, 2011 Order at 1.
Defendants’ Supplemental Brief references additional elements of §10(b) that are outside the scope of this order.
Lead Plaintiffs refer the Court to the arguments set forth in the Opposition Brief pertaining to Puffery (Opp. Br. at
16-20), the Safe Harbor (Opp. Br. at 24-29), Confidential Witnesses (Opp. Br. at 43-46), and Loss Causation (Opp.
Br. at 55-63).

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 5 of 21 PageID #: 1463

(1988) and TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)). As in Basic, the
Supreme Court again rejected a bright-line rule for materiality, and required a fact-specific
analysis of the “source, content, and context” of the alleged misstatement. Id. at 1321 (quoting
Basic, 485 U.S. at 232 (internal quotation omitted)). While “§ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) do not
create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information . . ., [d]isclosure is
required under these provisions only when necessary ‘to make . . . statements made, in the light
under which they were made, not misleading.’” Id. (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)).
To survive a motion to dismiss, Lead Plaintiffs “need only allege ‘enough facts to state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1322 n.12 (quoting Bell
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); Opp. Br. at 15. Matrixx reaffirms that the
allegations of materiality must simply “raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal
evidence,” id. at 1323 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556), and “allo[w] the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1940 (2009)).
The Facts of Matrixx Are Instructive
In Matrixx, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant company failed to disclose the
possible link between its cold medicine Zicam, the company’s core product, and the loss of the
sense of smell. Plaintiffs alleged that over several years, doctors and medical researchers had
contacted Matrixx to report a possible link. In September 2003, one of these doctors planned to
present his observations at a medical conference, but Matrixx warned he was unauthorized to
disclose the company’s name. Two months later, two product liability lawsuits were filed.
These developments threatened the commercial viability of Matrixx’s primary product. Matrixx,
131 S. Ct. at 1315-16.

4

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 6 of 21 PageID #: 1464

Under the guise of these risk warnings, rather than disclose the truth, Matrixx told
investors that Zicam was “poised for growth” and had “very strong momentum.” Id. at 1315.
Matrixx further expressed its expectation that revenues would “‘be up in excess of 50% and that
earnings, per share for the full year [would] be in the 25 to 30 cent range.’” Id. A few months
later, in January 2004, “Matrixx raised its revenue guidance, predicting an increase in revenues
of 80 percent and earnings per share in the 33-to-38-cent range.” Id.
All the while, Matrixx warned investors only of the potential “‘material adverse effect’
that could result from product liability claims, ‘whether or not proven to be valid,’” and further
stated that “product liability actions could materially affect Matrixx’s ‘product branding and
goodwill,’ leading to reduced customer acceptance.” Id. (citations omitted). In response to
media reports, Matrixx denied any connection between its product and the loss of smell, claiming
that such reports were unfounded and misleading. Id. at 1316.
The Supreme Court “believe[d] that these allegations suffice to ‘raise a reasonable
expectation that discovery will reveal evidence’ satisfying the materiality requirement.” Id. at
1323 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The Supreme Court concluded that “[v]iewing the
allegations of the complaint as a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk
to the commercial viability of Matrixx’s leading product.” Id. Such allegations establish that it
“is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information ‘as having
significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.’” Id. (citation omitted).
Defendants Concealed The Significant Risks To The Viability Of The PBM Business
Here, viewing the Complaint as a whole, Lead Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants
failed to disclose facts concerning the commercial viability of CVS Caremark’s PBM business
and the impact on the Company’s earnings. Contrary to Defendants’ attempt to narrow this case

5

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 7 of 21 PageID #: 1465

to one about potential contract losses, the Complaint alleges that Defendants concealed the link
between the (i) failed merger integration and service disruptions, and (ii) loss of over $4.5 billion
in terminated contracts during the Class Period. From the inception of the Merger, and
throughout the Class Period, investors and analysts expressed concern about the viability of the
Merger because of the Company’s ability to appropriately service its customers. Defendants
responded with materially false and misleading assurances. For example:


All About Service: The press release dated November 1, 2006 announcing the Merger
stated that the purpose included “providing high-quality, cost-effective services.” ¶51.
Upon announcement of the Merger, analysts expressed “serious concerns about the
‘merger of equals’ structure of the transaction and the heightened integration risk.” ¶57.
In response to these concerns, CEO Ryan acknowledged that customers “want to get
calmed down that . . . we’re still going to focus on execution and service.” ¶55. Ryan
further stated the Merger was “all about . . . service . . . we think we can out-service and
out-sell our competition here,” ¶54, meaning that profitable new business would have to
result from superior service, not bargain prices.



Systems Are Integrated: In January 2009, Ryan declared that the integration was
complete, “[a]ll the systems are able to talk to each other . . . We have got no issues with
our systems.” ¶121.



Client Satisfaction: Throughout 2008 and 2009, Defendants misrepresented that clients
“love[d] [CVS Caremark’s] integrated proactive pharmacy care offerings,” and that the
Company’s capabilities and offerings were “resonating with [] clients.” ¶¶112, 125, 133,
159. According to Defendants, both new and existing clients reported “high customer
satisfaction scores,” and the PBM business had “excellent client retention.” ¶¶125,159.



No Hidden Agenda: In January 2009, Defendants announced a surprise price reduction
for over half of the Company’s PBM clients. ¶¶96, 118. Analysts immediately
questioned whether poor service prompted this un-negotiated price cut. ¶¶96, 119. Ryan
responded that there was “No trade-offs because of our service . . . [T]here was no hidden
agenda here about giving a lower price because of lack of service.” ¶¶97, 120.



EPS Growth Of At Least 13-15%: On August 4, 2009, Ryan expressed “great
confidence” in the Company’s ability to retain existing clients and win new business
during the 2010 selling season. ¶159. Ryan stated that he “would be very disappointed if
[CVS Caremark] didn’t have an EPS growth of at least 13 to 15%” in 2010. ¶¶106, 160;
Opp. Br. at 11.

6

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 8 of 21 PageID #: 1466



We Can Deliver: As late as September 2009, CFO Rickard was touting new business, and
attributing it to “what we offer employers and other payors in terms of the products and
services that we now can deliver.” ¶172.
Like Matrixx, this “is not a case about a handful of anecdotal reports.” Matrixx, 131 S.

Ct. at 1322. As discussed in the Opposition Brief, for example, every Monday, Defendants
received Sales Pipeline Reports, which by May 2008 revealed that $6.25 billion annually in
contracts were at risk for termination, and nearly $3.5 billion annually in contracts were at
highest risk. ¶¶65-67; Opp. Br. at 35-36. Defendants also participated in monthly and quarterly
meetings to address the service issues. ¶¶68-70; Opp. Br. at 33, 42.
While Defendants told investors that they had “completed the integration” and that “[a]ll
the systems are able to talk to each other,” ¶71, integration issues, especially those related to
computer systems, were causing tens of thousands of claim errors, the need for manual data
entry, and the denial of benefits for eligible employees. ¶¶87-92. At the same time, internal
documents reflected tens of thousands of errors, resulting in denial of benefits and over 40,000
plan participants not receiving the appropriate medications. ¶¶87-88, 91. The failure of the
integration also resulted in significant over-billing. New Jersey alone was over-billed
approximately $40 million. ¶¶89-90; see also ¶¶78, 92.4 These facts, together with the others
alleged in the Complaint, suggest a “significant risk” to the viability of the Company’s PBM
business, and under Matrixx must have been disclosed.
To the contrary, Defendants concealed these facts from investors. As Ryan explained at
the close of the Class Period, while the Company had “honest, open discussion[s] of the areas
that need to be fixed,” he had been “hesitant to do it with the investor community.” ¶196. CVS
Caremark’s internal emails and documents reveal that employees were instructed to conceal the
4

These rampant integration issues and customer complaints led to low morale and high employee turnover,
including senior personnel at the highest ranks of the Company. ¶99. By March 2008, nearly half of the team
servicing New Jersey had left according to internal documents. Id.

7

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 9 of 21 PageID #: 1467

truth from customers as well. ¶¶101-05. As an April 2, 2008 email stated, in response to
customer complaints from New Jersey, CVS Caremark employees were admonished “NOT [to]
be telling [New Jersey account] callers that participants are not” entered in the computer
systems, and therefore cannot obtain their medications. ¶100. New Jersey explicitly raised these
service issues with CVS Caremark, writing in a May 6, 2008 email that these problems are
“directly impacting our client satisfaction . . . All this is unacceptable.” ¶102; see also ¶103
(regarding Blue Cross/Blue Shield of South Carolina). While by the Fall of 2008 it was well
known within the Company that Coventry was terminating its commercial contract, employees
were placed under a “gag order.” ¶79. Similarly, Ryan personally took part in a call with
Chrysler to address similar integration-related service issues. ¶¶93-94; Opp. Br. at 38-39.
As Ryan acknowledged on November 5, 2009, at the time Defendants issued their false
statements, they knew that the failed integration and service issues resulted in contract
terminations. For instance, at the close of the Class Period, Ryan disclosed that the contract with
Coventry—worth over $4 billion annually—was lost because of “service issues,” stating:
Coventry was a service issue. Coventry was an issue we had two
years ago. We lost the Med D business [in mid-2008] because in
my mind, because of service . . . But once the Med D went over,
[we] kind of knew we were going to lose the commercial business
the following year because it kind of just flows together . . . So
price is not the issue. We don’t want to—if we don’t want to lose
it for price, we’re not going to lose it because we buy them better
[than anybody else] but there were some messaging issues and then
some service issues.
¶197.
Ryan later stated: “we dropped the ball in some client service issues that we shouldn’t
have. And we’re owning up to it and we’re fixing it. So, that’s what happened, and it obviously
was a big one with Coventry because the natural falloff is we know we’re going to lose the
commercial business following [the loss of Med D].” ¶198. Indeed, over a year after
8

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 10 of 21 PageID #: 1468

Defendants declared that Caremark had been fully integrated, ¶71, in February 2010, the
Company disclosed that the PBM business “has five segments that haven’t been fully
integrated.” ¶200.
These disclosures were in stark contrast with Defendants’ statements in May 2009 when
they first disclosed the loss of the Coventry commercial contract. Rather than disclose the
specific reason, they merely indicated that the loss “was not unexpected,” following the loss in
2008 of the Coventry Med-D contract, which Rickard falsely claimed was “due in large part to
price.” ¶75.5
Earnings Guidance Was Materially False
Similarly, like the defendants in Matrixx, Defendants knew that their guidance of a
13-15% increase in earnings for 2010 was materially false and misleading at the time of their
statement on August 4, 2009—if not, the very next day. See Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1315. As
Ryan explained on November 5, 2009, the projection was based on the assumption of “low to
mid to single digits [growth] in our PBM business.” ¶¶106, 182. For argument’s sake, if the
years of complaints arising from tens of thousands of errors did not give rise to Defendants’
knowledge that New Jersey was terminating its contract, ¶¶87-89 (quoting emails and discussing
internal documents), New Jersey confirmed the termination in writing on August 5, 2009. ¶90.
With this confirmed contract loss—valued at over $1 billion annually—Defendants’ earnings
guidance was knowingly false.
Having just spoken to investors, Defendants had an immediate duty to disclose not only
the loss of the New Jersey contract, but more importantly that (i) the loss was due to Merger5

Defendants also concealed the material impact of regulations affecting the Company’s Med-D insurance
business, SilverScript Insurance Company. ¶110. Following the regulations’ enactment in February 2009, the
Company misrepresented that the Med-D business was “starting out basically right on plan early this year” with “no
surprises,” ¶126; see also ¶152 (referring to the regulatory change as a mere “headwind”). On November 5, 2009,
Defendants revealed for the first time that the regulation in fact reduced earnings by 10% or $1.7 billion. ¶182.

9

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 11 of 21 PageID #: 1469

integration issues, and (ii) as a result, the Company could not meet its previously disclosed
earnings guidance. See Opp. Br. at 20-24. Instead, Defendants waited three months to advise
investors of the impact of the New Jersey loss, despite having the opportunity in intervening
statements to the market in September and October 2009. ¶¶172-178. This delay provided time
for $40 million in personal stock sales between August and November 2009. ¶90; see also
¶¶106-09; Opp. Br. at 46-52.
Investors’ Reaction Further Supports Materiality
Lead Plaintiffs’ allegations of materiality are further supported by the telling reaction of
investors. Upon learning the truth, the share price collapsed 20% in a single day on 13 times the
average daily volume during the Class Period. ¶212; Opp. Br. at 22 n.8. Analysts reacted
harshly, writing, for example, that Defendants’ admission “provided undeniable evidence today
that it has mismanaged the Caremark acquisition and destroyed shareholder value.” ¶¶11, 193,
212. Another analyst concluded that the “[s]urprise nature of [the] disclosures raises credibility
issues” for CVS Caremark and its senior managers. ¶¶191, 212.
B.

The Complaint Satisfies The Anima Standard

Defendants do not address the fact that the First Circuit’s decision in Anima, which was
issued a week before Matrixx, is inconsistent with Matrixx in certain respects. As set forth in
Part I.A., the Supreme Court reaffirmed the contextual analysis of Basic and held that concealing
a “significant risk” may be material to shareholders. Anima, on the other hand, required a
showing of “near certainty” that the risk would materialize before disclosure is required. 2011
WL 924242, at *14. After Matrixx, this is no longer the law. Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1323. In
view of Matrixx, Plaintiffs in Anima are seeking en banc review.6

6

The Court of Appeals in Anima set out the legislative history of the PSLRA and its targeting of perceived
abuses in class action litigation and to curb frivolous lawyer-driven litigation. Anima, 2011 WL 924242, at *9-10.

10

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 12 of 21 PageID #: 1470

In Anima, the First Circuit acknowledged the “omission of a known risk, its probability of
materialization, and its anticipated magnitude, are usually material to any disclosure discussing
the prospective result from a future course of action.” Id. at *12 (quoting Lormand v. U.S.
Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 248 (5th Cir. 2009)). In reaching its conclusion, the First Circuit
recognized that in “cases where the risk approaches a certainty, courts have no difficulty in
finding a duty of disclosure. But where the level of risk is unknown and the existence of a risk is
disclosed, we shall hesitate to conclude that [a] disclosure is misleading merely because it did not
state that the risk was ‘serious.’” Id. at *15.7
The plaintiffs’ allegations in Anima centered on physicians’ insurance reimbursement for
using NeuroMetrix’s neurological scanning device. Anima, 2011 WL 924242, at *6. The
complaint in Anima alleged, inter alia, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) there was a “serious
risk” that insurers would disallow reimbursement for use of the company’s product, an issue of
“critical importance to [] profitability”; and (ii) internal experts believed that the company’s
business strategy regarding billing was incorrect and possibly fraudulent. Id. at *11, 12. The
First Circuit concluded the company “specifically [] disclosed” the risk that reimbursement
policies were unsettled and that denials would undermine the company’s business. Id. at *15
(emphasis in original). The Anima Court also considered the existence of internal disagreement
As the drafters of the PSLRA envisioned, this meritorious action is led by three public-sector pension funds, which
have suffered sizable losses due to Defendants’ fraud. Those institutional investors, appointed by the Court pursuant
to the PSLRA’s Lead Plaintiff provisions, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a), are fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility, filing a
Complaint that contains particularized allegations, quotation of internal documents and reports, and detailed factual
allegations exceeding the PSLRA’s stringent standard. Indeed, last week—nearly a year after Lead Plaintiffs filed
the Complaint—CVS Caremark disclosed that the SEC has issued a subpoena “requesting, among other corporate
records, information relating to public disclosures made by the Company in 2009 concerning its PBM and Medicare
Part D businesses and information concerning ownership and transactions in the Company’s securities by certain
officers of the Company.” CVS Caremark Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2011 at 12.
7
Defendants submit that Matrixx requires disclosure of only adverse events that “had actually transpired.”
Def. Supp. Br. at 6-7. Matrixx, however, held that the complaint need only allege “facts suggesting a significant
risk.” Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1323. The Supreme Court concluded that Matrixx was required to disclose
“information indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating product,” not merely events that had
actually transpired. Id. Nevertheless, here, Defendants knew that billions of dollars of contracts had in fact been
lost due to concealed service and merger-related problems during the Class Period.

11

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 13 of 21 PageID #: 1471

between certain reimbursement experts and senior management, but concluded the company had
no duty to disclose adverse opinions unless the failure of the chosen business strategy
approached “near certainty.” Id. at *14. In the context of the statements at issue, the Court
concluded no further disclosure was required. Id.
Here, the Complaint’s well-pled allegations meet even the higher, non-controlling
standard of Anima. As discussed in Part I.A. above, Defendants had actual knowledge of the fact
that the Merger had failed and that customers had terminated billions of dollars in contracts
during the Class Period due to poor service. Opp. Br. at 35-40. Lead Plaintiffs do not merely
allege “near certainty,” but actual knowledge that the undisclosed risk had come to pass. For
instance, as Ryan stated at the close of the Class Period, by mid-2008, Defendants knew that
Coventry terminated its Med D contract due to service issues and at that time learned that
Coventry was not renewing its commercial contract in May 2009 for the same reason. Opp. Br.
at 36-37.8
Similarly, on August 5, 2009, after New Jersey confirmed that it had terminated CVS
Caremark, Defendants knew their earnings guidance from the prior day was false. ¶106. Rather
than correct their prior statement and reveal that the loss of the contract was due to service
issues, Defendants made additional false statements to investors and unloaded $40 million in
stock despite their knowledge of material non-public adverse information.

The Court of Appeals also noted in Anima that plaintiffs had complained of “pervasive” problems, and while
“the PSLRA does not require plaintiffs to plead evidence . . . more meat was needed on these bones.” Anima, 2011
WL 924242, at *19 (quoting ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 63 (1st Cir. 2008)). In contrast, the
Complaint details numerous instances of persistent, consistent, and pointed complaints from CVS Caremark’s
clients, as well as Defendants’ efforts and instructions to conceal the truth from customers—allegations that
Defendants do not acknowledge. Supra I.A.; Opp. Br. at 6-10; ¶¶77-79, 87-89.

C.

Defendants’ Invocation of General Risk Disclosures Is
Unavailing Under Both Matrixx and Anima

Ignoring that the Complaint does not arise from “potential contract losses,” Defendants
argue that their disclosures were sufficient to avoid liability. Without any citation, Defendants
submit that “CVS Caremark had no duty to disclose the risk of specific potential contract losses,
particularly where CVS Caremark had already disclosed the general risk of contract losses in its
public filings.” Def. Supp. Br. at 4. In making this argument, Defendants quote their generic
disclosure that: “our failure to renew or win PBM business could adversely affect our business,
financial position and result of operation.” Def. Supp. Br. at 4; see also Opp. Br. at 26-27.
Defendants submit—again without citation—that, “[u]nder those circumstances, there is no need
to disclose anything further about risk of loss of any particular contract.” Def. Supp. Br. at 4.
Matrixx confirms that this is not the law. The Supreme Court rejected the invocation of
generic risk disclosures in the face of existing facts—especially if they indicate that the risk has
materialized. Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1315. Moreover, Defendants’ suggestion of a bright line
rule (i.e., that they had no duty to disclose the risk of specific potential contract losses, because
CVS Caremark had already disclosed the general risk of contract losses in its public filings) was
also expressly rejected in Matrixx. Id. at 1318-19.
Anima similarly assessed the context of the disclosures at issue. Like Matrixx, the First
Circuit recognized that while not all material facts need be disclosed, a company cannot “omit
any facts ‘necessary in order to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.’” Anima, 2011 WL 924242, at *12; Matrixx, 131 S. Ct.
at 1321. While applying the non-controlling “near certainty” standard, the First Circuit,
undertaking a fact-specific analysis, concluded that the particular risk at issue—the risk of nonreimbursement—was “specifically disclosed.” Id. at *14 (emphasis added). The First Circuit

13

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 15 of 21 PageID #: 1473

pointed to the fact that defendants “state explicitly that the ultimate resolution of the issue is
unknown and, by reasonable implications, out of its hands.” Id. at *14-15. Indeed, the First
Circuit recognized that defendants’ particular disclosures became more explicit over time about
the risks the company faced.
Anima distinguished between explicit risk warnings versus generic boilerplate disclosures
like those at issue here. Id. at *15 (“A statement of risk does not insulate the speaker from
liability, particularly where it is ‘generic and formulaic.’”) (citation omitted). Indeed, the First
Circuit recognized that in cases like this one, where “risks were referenced . . . by way of
generalized risk factors, and the real potential problems were ‘glossed over as a future risk of
limited magnitude,’” disclosure may be required. Id. at *13 (quoting Lormand, 565 F.3d at 247
(emphasis in original)).
Here, unlike Anima, the consequence of the failed Merger, customer dissatisfaction, and
service problems was known: the termination of $4.5 billion in contracts during the Class Period.
As discussed in Part I.A. above, Defendants’ attempt to point to boilerplate general risk
disclosures regarding the failure to renew or win PBM business in the future is unavailing. See
Opp. Br. at 26. At no point prior to November 5, 2009 did Defendants disclose the existence of
the contemporaneous service issues, the problems with the Merger integration, customer
complaints, or the true cause of the contract losses. Defendants have not, and cannot, dispute
this fact.9

Defendants contend that the Complaint fails to plead loss causation because the “contract losses that underlie
plaintiffs’ allegations had already been disclosed by the Company or was known publicly . . . ” Def. Supp. Br. at 2.
Like their other arguments, this contention is predicated on Defendants’ characterization—not the allegations—of
the Complaint. Lead Plaintiffs fully briefed loss causation and addressed Defendants’ argument in the Opposition
Brief at pages 55-63.

14

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 16 of 21 PageID #: 1474

For all the reasons herein and in Lead Plaintiffs’ Opposition Brief, these allegations
suffice to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence satisfying the
materiality requirement. Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.
II.

Matrixx Reaffirms That The Complaint Adequately Pleads
Defendants Acted With Fraudulent Scienter
The Matrixx Court reaffirmed the pleading standard for scienter under Tellabs, which

was addressed extensively in the Opposition Brief. Opp. Br. at 29-30. Plaintiffs must state with
particularity facts giving rise to the strong inference that defendants acted with scienter, “a
mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1323
(quoting Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 319 (2007)). Courts must
holistically review the allegations, taking into account “plausible opposing inferences,” and find
scienter if “a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as
compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id. at 1324
(quoting Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 323, 324, 326).
Fraudulent Scienter Is The Only Plausible Inference
The Supreme Court in Matrixx reaffirmed that the PSLRA “requires courts to take into
account ‘plausible opposing inferences’” from the facts alleged in the Complaint, which must be
accepted as true. Matrixx, 131 S. Ct. at 1324 (quoting Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 323); Opp. Br. at 30.
Having now submitted three briefs on the issue, Defendants have failed to offer any opposing
innocent inference, let alone one that is plausible. Other than conclusory arguments, Defendants
do not, and cannot, refute the Complaint’s allegations, including:


As Ryan stated at the end of the Class Period, he knew that Coventry’s contract was lost
due to service issues—not price—by May 2008, and he knew at that time that the
commercial contract would be lost for the same reason. In total, these contracts
accounted for $4 billion in annual revenue. Supra I.B.; ¶¶74-83; Opp. Br. at 36-37.

15

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 17 of 21 PageID #: 1475



By no later than August 5, 2009, Defendants knew that New Jersey had confirmed its
over $1 billion contract was terminated. By that date Defendants knew it was impossible
that the Company would meet the guidance of 13-15% earnings growth given only one
day earlier. ¶¶84-90, 106, 160; Opp. Br. at 38.



Internal CVS Caremark emails evidence frequent, consistent customer complaints, and
instructions to employees to conceal the true reason for the service problems—the failed
integration. ¶¶87-88, 101-04.



Defendants participated in monthly and quarterly conference calls where the details of
integration and service-related problems and complaints were addressed at length. ¶¶6870; Opp. Br. at 42.



Defendants received weekly Sales Pipeline Reports that reflected $6.5 billion annually in
contracts at risk of loss, and $3.5 billion annually at highest risk of loss. ¶67.

Defendants have not directly addressed these particularized allegations of scienter, nor have they
proffered any plausible competing innocent inference, let alone one that is more compelling.10
Defendants’ Insider Trading Further Supports A Strong Inference of Scienter
Defendants rely on the First Circuit’s decision in City of Dearborn Heights Act 345
Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. Waters Corp. (“Waters”), 632 F.3d 751 (1st Cir. 2011), to contend that
Defendants’ sales of over $40 million CVS Caremark stock from August 5, 2009 through the end
of the Class Period do not support a strong inference of scienter. While this argument is outside
the scope of the Court’s Procedural Order, and was previously briefed (See Opp. Br. at 46-52),
Lead Plaintiff is compelled to reply.

10

Defendants submit that the “relative significance of the affected business in relation to the company’s overall
business, is probative of whether or not defendants acted with requisite scienter in failing to disclose the underlying
negative information.” Def. Supp. Br. at 8 n.6. This much is correct. See, e.g., Opp. Br. at 40-42 (regarding core
operations). However, without citation, Defendants incorrectly—and categorically—state that the failure to disclose
a single contract cannot provide a basis for a strong inference of scienter. Id. Again, this case does not center on the
loss of a single contract, but the failure of CVS Caremark’s PBM business, which generated in excess of $8 billion
in annual revenue. See, e.g., ¶125. On November 5, 2009, Ryan disclosed that while his earnings guidance from
August 2009 included a low- to mid-single digit increase in the PBM business revenue, the PBM revenue would
decline between 10-12%. ¶182. Indeed, when the truth was revealed, one analyst concluded “[w]e do not consider
the value of the PBM segment in arriving at our price target [for CVS Caremark stock]. We view the PBM
essentially a free option.” ¶194. In essence, despite Defendants’ earlier statements to the contrary, the PBM
business provided no value to shareholders.

16

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 18 of 21 PageID #: 1476

Waters reaffirmed that allegations of insider trading “in suspicious amounts or at
suspicious times” support an inference of scienter. 632 F.3d at 760 (citations omitted); see also
Opp. Br. at 46-47. Although, contrary to Tellabs, Defendants address these insider sales in
isolation, Waters recognized that the context of a defendant’s stock sales, including selling
history, stock price movement, and timing relative to the disclosure of the truth, must be
considered as part of a holistic analysis. Waters, 632 F.3d at 761. Waters also concluded that in
addition to considering the shares of stock that defendants held, the court should also consider
the number of shares a defendant could have sold through their exercise of vested options. Id.;
see also Opp. Br. at 47 n.24.
Based on the facts in Waters, where no other allegations—individually or holistically—
supported a strong inference of scienter, 632 F.3d at 760-61, the First Circuit concluded that the
allegations of insider sales were also insufficient. One defendant sold his shares early in the
class period at a price near the low for the period, and another defendant repurchased shares
throughout the class period. Id. at 761, 762. The third defendant sold 7% of his shares during
the third quarter, and 22% of the remainder in the fourth quarter, at a price only slightly lower
than the class period high. Id. at 761. While the facts pertaining to this defendant “could lend
support to plaintiff’s inference of scienter,” the First Circuit concluded that “no context [was]
provided” to give rise to a strong inference of scienter. Id. (citing Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,
194 F.3d 185, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1999)).
Here, in contrast, the context of Defendants’ insider sales, considered together with all of
Lead Plaintiffs’ other particularized allegations, further supports a strong inference of scienter.
See Opp. Br. at 47. Over a three month period, beginning immediately after Ryan provided the
misleading earnings guidance, Defendants disposed of more than one million shares of Company

17

Case 1:09-cv-00554-JNL-PAS Document 47 Filed 05/13/11 Page 19 of 21 PageID #: 1477

stock, resulting in over $40 million in proceeds. ¶¶9, 106-09, 204-06, 208. All of Rickard’s and
McLure’s Class Period sales, and 99.6% of Ryan’s sales during the Class Period, took place after
Defendants’ false statements (and omissions) regarding CVS Caremark’s 2010 outlook and after
the receipt of the August 5, 2009 letter confirming the loss of the New Jersey account. See, e.g.,
¶¶109, 206. The Individual Defendants’ sales include:


Defendant McLure, head of the PBM segment, sold 500,000 shares of CVS Caremark
stock, or 60% of his personally held shares, including vested options, for a total of
approximately $17.7 million in proceeds. ¶¶107, 109, 205; Opp. Br. at 47 and n.24.
McLure was fired as a result of the failed Merger. ¶190; Opp. Br. at 12.



Defendant Ryan, CEO, sold 400,000 shares of CVS Caremark stock, or approximately
7% of his personally held shares, including vested options, for total proceeds of
approximately $13.7 million. ¶¶107, 109, 205; Opp. Br. at 47 and n.24.



Defendant Rickard, CFO, sold 251,520 shares of Company stock, 19.6% of his
personally held shares during the Class Period, including vested options, for proceeds of
approximately $8.5 million. ¶¶107, 109, 205; Opp. Br. at 47 and n.24.
Defendants attempt to invoke a 10b5-1 trading plan that was adopted during the Class

Period, at a time when Defendants had possessed material, non-public information. This defense
is unavailing and has been consistently rejected by courts. Opp. Br. at 50-52. Indeed, since the
end of the Class Period, Ryan has not made a single sale despite the existence of the 10b5-1
trading plan. ¶109; Opp. Br. at 48.
In view of the factual context, Defendants’ insider sales further support a strong inference
of scienter, individually and holistically with the Complaint’s well-pled allegations.
