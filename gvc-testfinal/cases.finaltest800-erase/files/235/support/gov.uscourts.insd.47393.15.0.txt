Plaintiff,

INDIANA DEPARTMENT

Defendant(s).

Cause No. 1:13-CV-00982-JMS-DKL

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Wendy Knight (“Defendant”), by counsel, Grant E. Helms, Deputy Attorney
General, respectfully requests the Court to enter summary judgment in her favor pursuant to FED.
R. CIV. P. 56 and Local Rule 56-1, as there is no genuine issue of material fact and the Defendant
is entitled to judgment in her favor as a matter of law. In support of this Motion, Defendant
states the following:
1.

Plaintiff Shaun Steele brought his claims against various Department of

Correction officials, but the Court severed misjoined claims on June 28, 2013 (DE 6), and then
screened the remaining claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) (DE 12).
2.

The Plaintiff has alleged that the conditions of his confinement at the Correctional

Industrial Facility were unconstitutional because he was denied access to a toilet for extended
periods of time, there was excessive heat, and a lack of fresh air and space. (See DE 12 at 1.)
Constitutional claims are, of course, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
3.

The Defendant answered Plaintiff’s Complaint on September 30, 2013.

4.

The Defendant has presented the affirmative defense that the Plaintiff failed to

exhaust his administrative remedies at the facility before filing the lawsuit.

5.

The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides that prisoners must first

exhaust all available administrative remedies at the facility before the prisoner may properly
bring a § 1983 claim. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 204 (2007).
6.

The Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies established through

Correctional Industrial Facility’s grievance procedure for the allegations at issue.
7.

Therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact, the Defendant is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law, and the case should be decided in the Defendant’s favor.
8.

In support of this Motion, the Defendant submits and designates the following

evidence, all of which is incorporated herein by reference:

9.

a)

the Complaint;

b)

the Affidavit of Executive Assistant Matt Worthman;

c)

Plaintiff’s full Grievance History;

d)

e)

the Department of Correction Grievance policy, # 00-02-301.

The Defendant has contemporaneously filed a Memorandum supporting this

Motion, which is incorporated herein by reference.
WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully requests this Court to grant her Motion for
Summary Judgment and to grant all other just and proper relief.

Respectfully submitted,
