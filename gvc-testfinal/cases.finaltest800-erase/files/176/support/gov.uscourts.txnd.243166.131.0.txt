vs : 4-14-CR-023-A
CHRISTOPHER ROBERT WEAST (1) :

MOTION FOR LEAVE OF COURT TO FILE
MOTION TO SUPPRESS

COMES NOW, Christopher Robert Weast, through counsel, Assistant Federal Public
Defender Angela R. Saad, and respectfully moves this Court for an order granting the Defendant
leave of court to file a Motion to Suppress out of time for the following reason:

1. The Defendant is scheduled for trial on July 28, 2014. Pursuant to the Court's order in
this case, pretrial motions must be filed June 11, 2014.

2. Defense counsel was appointed February 21, 2014 to represent Mr. Weast. On April 22,
2014, counsel's appointment was terminated. Defense counsel was reappointed on June 5, 2014 for
the competency hearing. On July 8, 2014, we were again reappointed to represent the defendant for
the trial. On July 15, 2014, the Court denied our motion for reconsideration of appointment of
counsel. While defense counsel was appointed to represent the defendant when the June 11, 2014
deadline passed, the scope of representation was limited to "the competency hearing and related
matters." Based on the foregoing, defense counsel respectfully requests leave of court to file the
Motion to Suppress out of time.

3. Counsel respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant leave to file the Motion to
Suppress out of time.

WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court to allow counsel
