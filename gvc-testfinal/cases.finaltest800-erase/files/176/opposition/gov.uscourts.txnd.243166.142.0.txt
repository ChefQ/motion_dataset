UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CLERA OF COURT
Vv. No. 4:14-CR-023-A
CHRISTOPHER ROBERT WEAST (01)
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO WEAST'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS

TO THE HONORABLE JOHN McBRYDE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, by and through the
undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, files this response in opposition to Weast's
motion to suppress and shows the Court as follows:
Issues
(1) Does the defendant have a reasonable expectation of privacy in computer files that he
shares with the public?
(2) Does the defendant have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an IP address that is
available to the public or an Internet account that contains information voluntarily
provided by the subscriber?
Summary

The defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in files that he shares with
the public. Second, the defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in subscriber
information maintained by an internet service provider because there is no legitimate

expectation of privacy in information voluntarily turned over to third parties.

Relevant Facts

In June 2012, Fort Worth Police Department Officer Randy Watkins initiated a
peer-to-peer file sharing investigation in order to identify individuals in the Fort Worth
area who were distributing child pornography files over the Internet. On June 4, 2012,
Officer Watkins used a program called Child Protection System (CPS) to obtain a list of
IP addresses in the Fort Worth area that had offered to distribute known or suspected
child pornography. Officer Watkins identified an IP address, 99.71.201.174, which was
offering to share files via the Internet using the Gnutella Network. According to the CPS
program, a computer using IP address 99.71.201.174 was offering more than 1,000 files
that appeared to be images or videos of known or suspected child pornography. |

On the same day, Officer Watkins used ShareazaLE, * a file-sharing program to
make a direct, single-source connection between Watkins's undercover computer and
defendant Weast's computer (subsequently identified), which was using the IP address
99,71,.201.174 to make child pornography files available. Thereafter, between June 4,
2012 and June 19, 2012, the defendant's computer shared 66 files of child pornography--
all of which were publicly available at the time Officer Watkins downloaded these files.
Officer Watkins also noticed in the download log files that the computer sharing files of

child pornography had a nickname, "Chris."

 

' The CPS system compares SHA values of images and videos against a database of images and videos known to or
suspected of being child pornography. A SHA value is a Secure Hash Algorithm, similar to an electronic fingerprint
for files.

? Like other publicly available programs, ShareazaLE allows law enforcement to download files from other
computers on the same file-sharing network. While this program permits law enforcement to download files entirely
from a single source rather than from multiple sources, it does not give law enforcement any greater access to
another peer-to-peer user's computer than that available to the rest of the public.

Using another publicly available tool, CentralOps.net, Officer Watkins determined
that the IP address 99.71.201.174 was owned by SBC Internet Services. Officer Watkins
requested a subpoena through the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office for
subscriber information for the Internet account assigned to IP address 99.71.201.174, on
June 4, 2012 at 19:21 GMT (the date and time Officer Watkins downloaded child
pornography from that IP address.) AT&T responded to the subpoena and provided the
name of the account holder, Larry Weast, and the service location assigned to the Internet
account, 833 Hallvale Road, White Settlement, Texas. Based on the images that Officer
Watkins downloaded and the location of the IP address for the computer distributing
child pornography, Officer Watkins obtained a search warrant for the Weast residence in
White Settlement.

When Officer Watkins executed a search warrant at the Weast residence, he seized
a number of computers and electronic storage devices, including items from defendant
Weast's bedroom. A forensic examination of devices located in Weast's bedroom
revealed the presence of file-sharing software and child pornography. [a copy of the
search warrant and affidavit, which describe the officer's method of downloading files
are included in Exhibit A.]

Argument and authorities

A. Publicly available files are not protected by the Fourth Amendment

Weast now contends that, while he made files publicly available through his
computer, law enforcement's access to those files encroached on his Fourth Amendment
right to privacy.

Response Motion to Suppress - Page 3 of 9
 

To establish a Fourth Amendment violation, the defendant must show that he had
"a reasonable expectation of privacy" in the property to be searched. United States v.
Setser, 568 F.3d 482, 490 (5th Cir. 2009). That showing requires the defendant "to prove
that he had (1) an actual, subjective expectation of privacy, and (2) that the expectation is
one which society would recognize as reasonable." /d. at 490-91 (internal quotations,
citation omitted); see also, Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967) (concurring
opinion). "What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or
office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection." Katz, 389 US. at 351.
Therefore, in challenging an alleged "search" of his publicly shared computer folder,
defendant bears the burden of establishing both a subjective and an objective expectation
of privacy.

The Ninth Circuit has concluded a defendant has no reasonable expectation of
privacy in files that he makes available through file sharing software. United States v.
Borowy, 595 F.3d 1045, 1047 (9th Cir. 2010).

The Eleventh Circuit also rejected the argument that law enforcement improperly
and unconstitutionally "electronically trespassed" on a defendant's property when it
accessed the publicly shared folder of a defendant's computer. In United States v.
Norman, 448 F. App'x 895 (11th Cir. 2011) (unpublished opinion)( copy attached), the
defendant complained of the government's use of specialized software without a warrant
to obtain information on his computer from the shared folder of a file-sharing program.
id, at 896, As a result, the defendant argued, the evidence subsequently seized during the

execution of a search warrant at his residence was unlawfully obtained. Jd.

Se

The appellate court first recognized that Norman's act of placing the contents of
his folder in the public domain negated any reasonable expectation of privacy in the
folder. /d. at 897. Further, Norman's objection to law enforcement's use of "unique"
software not available to the general public was "misplaced," because they acquired the
same information he made available to the public. Jd. Hence, Norman's motion to
suppress was properly denied. /d.

Although the Fifth Circuit has not addressed this particular issue, one Western
District of Texas court has arrived at a similar conclusion as the Eleventh Circuit in
Norman and other circuits-- no reasonable expectation of privacy exists in files made
publicly available through file-sharing programs. United States v. Dodson, 960
F Supp.2d 689 (W.D. Texas 2013). Dodson is factually very similar to Weast's case.
Dodson involved an agent using the Child Protection System (CPS) program to locate
users sharing child pornography on file-sharing networks. /d. at 692. Investigation in
that case began after the agent downloaded a child pornography file and sent a summons
to AT&T to acquire the subscriber information associated with the IP address that was
being used to share child pornography. Jd. at 693. Law enforcement then obtained and
executed a search warrant at the Dodson residence. 7d. Dodson challenged use of the
CPS software system as constituting a warrantless search of his computer; the district
court disagreed. Ja. at 694.

Once again, the court first examined (1) whether the defendant was able to
establish an actual, subjective expectation of privacy with respect to the place being

searched or the items being seized, and (2) whether that expectation of privacy was one

that society would recognize as reasonable. /d. (citing United States v. Gomez, 276 F.3d
694, 697 (Sth Cir. 2001)). The court then concluded that the defendant had no
expectation of privacy "because Defendant had already exposed the entirety of his files to
the many unknown users" on the file-sharing network, "which is the exact opposite of
exhibiting an expectation of privacy." /d. (also citing United States v. Yang, 478 F.3d
832, 835 (7th Cir. 2007)).

The district court also conciuded that society would not willingly recognize an
expectation of privacy where a user of file-sharing software had publicly shared files. 7d.
at 695. In support, the court relied on an unpublished decision out of the Northern
District of Texas as well decisions from several other circuits.' Id.

Norman and Dedson are directly on point. Weast had no reasonable expectation
of privacy in his Shareaza shared folder, which contained child pornography viewed by
law enforcement. Using software available to law enforcement, Officer Watkins
identified the defendant's computer as a likely distributor of child pornography. This
identification was possible because the contents of Weast's shared folder on his computer
were available to members of the public through the use of a peer-to-peer file sharing
program. Moreover, the software Officer Watkins used did not search any areas of
Weast's computer, download any files, or otherwise reveal any information that was

unavailable to ordinary internet users.

 

0x00B0 United States v. Samples, 2011 WL 4907315, *5 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 15, 2011) (Finding no ineffective assistance of
counsel where counsel failed to challenge the use of forensic software to download files in a file-sharing case
"because a user has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his public files'); Borowy, 595 F.3d at 1048: United
States v. Stults, 575 F.3d 834, 842-45 (8th Cir. 2009); and United States v. Perrine, 518 F.3d 1196, 1205 (10th Cir,
2008).

sais "aka"

Accordingly, Weast cannot establish that he had a reasonable expectation of
privacy in files that he made available to the public, and his claims of a Fourth
Amendment violation must fail.

B. There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in subscriber information

Weast also contends that law enforcement's use of a subpoena to obtain subscriber
information associated with his IP address violates the Fourth Amendment. Computers
use IP addresses to communicate with each other, similar to the post office using a home
address to deliver mail to a resident. There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in an
IP address. United States v. Christie, 624 F.3d 558, 573 (3d Cir. 2010); see also, Dodson,
960 F.Supp.2d at 693, n.5).

The government is unclear as to what privacy expectation Weast asserts that he
possessed in the subscriber information related to his father's internet account. But
regardless, there is also no Fourth Amendment protection in customer accounts
maintained by and for an Internet provider's business. "Subscriber information provided
to an internet provider is not protected by the Fourth Amendment's privacy expectation
because it is voluntarily conveyed to third parties." Christie, 624 F.3d at 573; see also,
United States v. Perrine, 518 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir. 2008) ("Every federal court to
address this issue has held that subscriber information provided to an internet provider is

not protected by the Fourth Amendment's privacy expectation.")"

 

* Perrine cites the following cases in support of its conclusion: Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 336 (6th Cir,
2001)(consistent holding in a non-criminal context); United States v. Hambrick, 225 F.3d 656 (4th Cir, 2000)
(unpublished), United States v. Forrester, 512 F.3d 500, 510 (9th Cir. 2008); United States v. Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173,
190 (2d Cir. 2004).

Case 4:14-cr-00023-A. Document 142 Filed 07/21/14 Page.8 of 26 PagelD 789

In the Perrine case, the defendant, like Weast, used file-sharing software to make
files available to the public through the Internet. The Tenth Circuit court found, "To the
extent such access could expose his subscriber information to outsiders, that additionally
vitiates any expectation of privacy he might have in his computer and its contents."
Perrine, 518 F.3d 1205.

Riley v. California does not abrogate the holdings by these numerous courts that
subscriber information is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. 134 S.Ct. 2473 (U.S.
2014). Riley involved two defendants whose ceil phones were searched pursuant to their
arrest. /d. at 2480-81. In those cases, the Fourth Amendment was triggered by the
defendants' arrests, and the officers sought to search the cell phones pursuant to an
exception to the warrant requirement--search incident to arrest. /d. at 2482.

Here, there was no "search" by the government to raise the protections of the
Fourth Amendment. See, Borowy, 595 F.3d at 1047, (Under Kaiz..., government
conduct qualifies as a search only if it violates a reasonable expectation of
privacy.")(internal citation omitted). Officer Watkins acquired publicly available child
pornography files; his conduct did not amount to a search because Weast had no
reasonable expectation of privacy in those files. Similarly, Weast has no reasonable
expectation of privacy in the IP address and subscriber information voluntarily provided

by Weast's father,

Therefore, the government respectfully requests the Court deny Weast's motion to

suppress.
