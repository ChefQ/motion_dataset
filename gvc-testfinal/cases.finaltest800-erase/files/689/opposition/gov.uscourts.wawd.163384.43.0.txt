Plaintiffs Bruce Keithly, Donovan Lee, Edith Anna Cramer, and Matthew Bebbington,
through their counsel, submit this reply in support of their motion to consolidate the abovecaptioned cases, appoint each named Plaintiff as interim lead plaintiffs, and appoint the law firms

Cohen Milstein and Keller Rohrback as interim class co-counsel.

ARGUMENT
6
7

In Defendants Intelius, Inc. and Intelius Sales, L.L.C.’s (collectively “Defendants” or

8

“Intelius”) response to Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendants indicate that they do not oppose Plaintiffs’

9

request to transfer Bebbington v. Intelius, Inc. et al., Case No. C10-500 RAJ (the “Bebbington

10
11

action”) for consolidation with Keithly v. Intelius, Inc. et al., Case No. C09-1485 RSL (the
“Keithly action”). Thus, the Court should consolidate those actions for the reasons stated in

12
Plaintiffs’ underlying motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).
13
14

With respect to Defendants’ contention that the request should not delay or otherwise

15

impact the Court’s consideration of Defendants’ motion to dismiss currently pending before the

16

Honorable Robert S. Lasnik, Plaintiffs submit that the instant motion to consolidate should be

17

determined before the motion to dismiss. Federal district courts routinely consolidate cases in

18
19

similar circumstances. For example, one district court faced with two related actions and a
pending motion to dismiss sua sponte determined that consolidation was appropriate before

20
21
22

determining the motion to dismiss. See Ashcroft v. New York State Dept. of Corr. Servs., No.
07-721, 2009 WL 1161480, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. April 29, 2009). The court specifically held that

23

“[c]onsolidation will not cause confusion or prejudice in the management of the case; rather, the

24

pending motion to dismiss as to the claims now to be consolidated into the first action … may

25

refine these issues while not delaying progress in either case.” Id. (citing 9 Charles A. Wright &

26

Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2383 (Civil 2d ed.)); see also Apostolou v.

Gelderman, Inc., 919 F. Supp. 289, 292 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (finding that the consolidation of eleven

2

cases was appropriate prior to resolution of a motion to dismiss).

3

After the cases are consolidated, the transferee judge has the discretion to consider the

4
allegations made in the transferred case. See, e.g., 9 Wright & Miller, § 2383 (Civil 3d ed.)
5
6

(“[O]nce cases have been consolidated, if the focused issues they address are common to all of

7

the actions, the district judge on his or her own initiative may consider motions directed at one of

8

the cases as if they were directed at all of the consolidated cases.”). The wisdom of this

9

approach is plainly evident: it would be a waste of judicial resources and contrary to the spirit

10

and policy of Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a) if the parties were exposed to inconsistent adjudications of

11

common legal issues. Here, there are additional allegations in the Bebbington action which

12
warrant their inclusion into the Court’s consideration when ruling on Defendants’ motion to
13
14

dismiss the Keithly action. For instance, the Bebbington action alleges that Defendants hired

15

“psychologists and behavioral specialists to carefully design the [webpages] to hit human

16

psychological cues and obfuscate any purported disclosures, in an effort to cause Plaintiff and

17

the Class to inadvertently enroll in the Negative Option Programs.” See Bebbington Compl.,

18
19

¶ 22. These allegations are centrally related to whether Defendants have engaged in deception in
violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW Ch. 19.86 et. seq. As a result, the

20
21
22
23
24
25
26

Court should consider the claims raised by the Bebbington complaint when ruling on the pending
motion to dismiss. Alternatively, the Court in its discretion may certainly direct Plaintiffs to file
an amended consolidated class complaint.
Defendants also suggest that Plaintiffs’ request for appointment of interim class counsel
is both unnecessary and premature, claiming that Defendants intend to oppose Plaintiffs’ request
for class certification. However, Defendants do not cite any authority or case law for this

proposition, nor do they otherwise assert any facts which would preclude the Court from making

2

a determination on whether to appoint interim class counsel at this time. The Federal Rules of

3

Civil Procedure explicitly provide that interim class counsel may be appointed prior to any

4
request for class certification, thereby undermining any objection raised by Defendants that they
5
6

will somehow be prejudiced by the Court’s ruling on this issue before class certification. See

7

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(3) (“The court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of a putative

8

class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action.”) (emphasis added).

9

Finally, Plaintiffs note that on April 14, 2010, the Multidistrict Judicial Panel on

10

Litigation (“JPML”) denied Defendants’ motion for centralization pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407

11

of a related action pending in the Central District of California. See Dkt. #42 in the Keithly

12
action. The JPML’s order means that both the Keithly and Bebbington actions will be litigated in
13
14

this district and that the California action will not be transferred here. With the JPML motion no

15

longer pending, there is no reason to postpone consideration of Plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate

16

for appointment of interim class counsel. Plaintiffs therefore request that the Court grant their

17

motion in its entirety.

18
19

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask the Court to enter the proposed order

20
21

submitted by Plaintiffs with their original motion for consolidation.
