Case 2:09-cv-01485-RSL Document 41 Filed 04/12/2010 Page 2of3

Plaintiffs in the above-captioned matters have requested that the later-filed action,
Bebbington v. Intelius, inc. et al., be transferred to the Honorable Judge Robert Lasnik for
consolidation with Keithly v. Intelius, Inc. et al., (""Keithly'), a pre-existing action.

Defendants Intelius, Inc. and Intelius Sales, LLC (collectively, `Intelius") do not
oppose Plaintiffs' request. However, Intelius respectfully submits that the request should not
delay or otherwise impact the Court's consideration of Intelius' pending Motion to Dismiss the
Keithly action (Docket No. 18), which has been fully briefed.

With respect to Plaintiffs' concurrent request for appointment of interim class counsel,
Intelius believes the request is both unnecessary and premature. As stated in the parties' Joint
Status Report, at the appropriate time, Intelius intends to oppose Plaintiffs' request for class
certification in these matters.

DATED this 12" day of April, 2010.
