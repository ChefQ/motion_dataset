Plaintiffs Bruce Keithly, Donovan Lee, Edith Anna Cramer, and Matthew Bebbington,
through their counsel, respectfully move the Court to transfer Bebbington v. Intelius, Inc. et al.,
C10-500 RAJ to the Honorable Chief Judge Robert Lasnik; to consolidate their cases; to appoint
Plaintiffs Matthew Bebbington, Bruce Keithly, Donovan Lee and Edith Anna Cramer as Interim

Lead Plaintiffs; and to appoint Cohen Milstein and Keller Rohrback as Interim Class CoCounsel.
BACKGROUND

8
9

Plaintiffs Keithly, Lee and Cramer (collectively the “Keithly Plaintiffs”) represented by

10

Cohen Milstein, with Keller Rohrback L.L.P. serving as local counsel, filed a complaint against

11

Intelius, Inc. and Intelius Sales, LLC (collectively, “Defendant” or “Intelius”) on October 19,

12
2009, alleging that Intelius’s participation in a post-transaction marketing scheme violates the
13
14

Washington Consumer Protection Act (“WCPA”). The Keithly Plaintiffs seek damages and an

15

injunction barring this type of conduct for themselves and a national class of similarly situated

16

persons. On March 24, 2010, Plaintiff Matthew Bebbington, represented by Keller Rohrback

17

L.L.P., filed a class action complaint against Intelius, alleging that Intelius’s use of in-cart and

18
19

post-transaction marketing techniques to boost sales and profits is a deceptive trade practice and
impermissible under the WCPA. Plaintiff Bebbington, too, seeks damages and injunctive relief.

20
21
22

These Plaintiffs now move jointly to transfer the Bebbington action, to consolidate the two
actions and to appoint Keller Rohrback L.L.P. and Cohen Milstein as interim class co-counsel.

23

Shortly after the Keithly action was filed, Defendant Intelius asked the Judicial Panel on

24

Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) to transfer a similar case – Baxter v. Intelius, Inc., et al., Case

25

No. 8:09-cv-01031-AG-RSM (C.D. Cal.) – from the Central District of California to this

District.1 Baxter is more narrowly drawn than Keithly and Bebbington; there, the plaintiff alleges

2

violations of California law against Intelius on behalf of California residents only.2 The JPML

3
4

heard argument on this motion on March 25 and is expected to rule within the next two weeks.
On April 1, 2010, Intelius' counsel Tyler Farmer filed a Supplemental Declaration with the

5

JPML, testifying that other plaintiffs’ firms are advertising their own “investigations” of the

7

post-transaction marketing practices at issue in these lawsuits. See Griffin Decl. at Ex. 2,

Consolidation of Cases Pending in this District Would Promote the Efficient
Litigation and Fair Resolution of Plaintiffs’ Claims.
Under F.R.C.P. 42, district courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases. Fed. R.

11
12

Civ. P. 42(a). Consolidation is appropriate where the actions involve common questions of law

13

or fact and consolidation will increase the likelihood of efficient and consistent proceedings.

14

See, e.g., Investors Research Co. v. U. S. Dist. Court, 877 F.2d 777 (9th Cir. 1989); Kemper

15

Sports Mgmt., Inc. v. Westport Investment, LLC, No. 07-5468 BHS, 2007 WL 4219355, at *2

16
17

(W.D. Wash. Nov. 28, 2007).
The claims in Keithly and Bebbington are very similar as they arise from the same

18
19

operative facts, cover the same time period, and involve the same defendants, though the

20

Bebbington Complaint contains additional facts that were not known or did not exist at the time

21

the Keithly Complaint was filed, such as Congressional Hearings held in November, 2009. In

22
23

addition, the cases are both at the early stages of litigation. Thus, consolidation of the two
actions is appropriate under Fed. R.Civ. P. 42(a). Consolidation will also not prejudice

Defendant. Rather, consolidation will allow Intelius to defend a single suit involving the same

2

facts and witnesses instead of two separate suits before the same Court. Accordingly,

3
4

consolidation is in the interests of judicial economy and will promote the efficient resolution of
these matters. Plaintiffs respectfully suggest, moreover, that merging these cases into a single

5
6

action will achieve the greatest judicial economy without changing or compromising any of the

7

parties’ rights and thus is appropriate here. See Kemper, 2007 WL 4219355, at *2; Travelers

Indemnity Co. v. Longview Fibre Paper & Packaging, Inc., No. 07-1009 BHS, 2007 WL

2916541, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 5, 2007).

10

II.

11

Appointment of Plaintiffs’ Counsel as Interim Class Counsel Will Serve the Best
Interests of the Proposed Classes.

12

Rule 23(g)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enables courts to “designate

13

interim counsel to act on behalf of the putative class before determining whether to certify the

14

action as a class action.” To protect the class interests and advance the litigation efficiently and

15

expeditiously, courts routinely appoint interim lead counsel at early stages in the litigation. See,

16
17
18

e.g., Pfaff v. Washington, No. 07-5280 RJB, 2007 WL 4225059, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 27,
2007); In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., No. 07-5944 SC, 2008 WL 2024957, at *1

19

(N.D. Cal. May 9, 2008). Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class they seek to represent

20

therefore respectfully ask the Court to appoint Plaintiffs as Interim Lead Plaintiffs, and to

21

appoint their counsel to act as Interim Class Co-Counsel (until an order on Plaintiffs’ motion for

22

class certification is entered) for the following purposes:

23

(1)

To coordinate all proceedings, including preparing, structuring, and
presenting pretrial and other management-related orders to the Court;

(2)

To act as spokesperson at all Court hearings and conferences;

To consult with and employ experts, as necessary;

To delegate work responsibilities and monitor the activities of all
Plaintiffs’ counsel to assure that schedules are met and unnecessary
expenditures of time and expense are avoided;

(7)

To create any necessary committees and appoint committee chairs and
otherwise delegate responsibilities for specific tasks in a manner to assure
that the pretrial preparation for the various Plaintiffs is conducted
effectively, efficiently, and economically;

(8)

To encourage full cooperation and efficiency among all Plaintiffs’
counsel;

matters addressed in this paragraph; and

Rule 23(g)(4) mandates that the attorneys appointed to serve as class counsel must “fairly
and adequately represent the interests of the class.” Although Rule 23(g)(3) does not provide a
standard for selecting interim class counsel, “a court may consider the factors enumerated in
Rule 23(g)(1).” Levitte v. Google, Inc., No. 08-3369 JW, 2009 WL 482252, at *2 (N.D. Cal.,

20
21
22

Feb. 25, 2009). Under these factors, courts must consider the following criteria in selecting class
counsel:

23

•

the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating
potential claims in the action;

•

counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other
complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the
action;

13

firms have been monitoring legislative and regulatory activities, as well as public enforcement

actions, related to Internet commerce; Plaintiffs’ counsel have obtained and reviewed all of the

15

hundreds of complaints about Intelius’s practices that have been received by the Washington

16
17
18

Attorney General and requested the same from the Better Business Bureau. Counsel have
identified and contacted potential experts.

19

Proposed Interim Class Counsel have already committed the time and efforts of

20

numerous attorneys to the legal research, factual investigation, and prosecution of these cases,

21

and will continue to do so, keeping in mind appropriate staffing levels for each project.

Moreover, Counsel have the resources needed to litigate this case vigorously for as long is as
