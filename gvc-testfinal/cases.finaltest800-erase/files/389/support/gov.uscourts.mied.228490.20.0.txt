DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
2:08-cv-11066-SFC-VMM Doc#20 Filed 01/12/09 Pg2o0f27 PgID 327

NOW COME, Defendants, County of Genesee, Captain Chris Swanson and Sheriff
Robert Pickell, by and through their attorneys, Plunkett Cooney, and move this Honorable Court
for Summary Judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(C) for the following reasons:
1. Plaintiffs instituted this action against Defendants with the filing of the Complaint
on or about March 12, 2008.
2. The factual basis concerning the Complaint essentially involves a towing
company that was on the "No Preference Wrecker Call List" (`"`the list") for Genesee:County.
Because another towing company was added to the list, in the same township as Plaintiffs, and
because Plaintiffs were ultimately removed from the list, they brought suit against Defendants
alleging the following counts:
(1) Fifth Amendment violation of constitutional rights;
(2) Procedural due process violations;
(3) Intentional interference with prospective contractual relations between
Plaintiff and customers;

(4) Intentional interference with prospective contractual relations between
Plaintiff and an individual;

(5) Intentional interference with prospective contractual relations between
Plaintiffs.

3, As set forth more fully in the brief in support of this motion, Plaintiffs will be
unable to prove that Defendants required them to relinquish a constitution right in violation of

the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.

 
2:08-cv-11066-SFC-VMM Doc#20 Filed 01/12/09 Pg3o0f27 PgID 328

4. Plaintiffs cannot establish a due process claim because they cannot demonstrate
the requisite property interest necessary to sustain such a claim.

5. Plamtiffs will be unable to show that there was interference with contractual
relations as the operation of a police department is a governmental function for purposes of
immunity from tort liability.

6. As such, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

7: Concurrence in the motion was sought and requested by counsel for Defendants
through the course of many conversations during which concurrence could not be obtained.

WHEREFORE, Defendants, County of Genesee, Captain Chris Swanson and Sheriff
Robert Pickell pray this Honorable Court grant their Motion for Summary Judgment together
with such additional relief this Court deems just and proper.

I_ INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs have filed this lawsuit against Defendants Captain Chris Swanson and Sheriff
Robert Pickell, both individually and in their official capacities, as well as the County of
Genesee, alleging a Fifth Amendment violation, procedural due process violations as well as
intentional interference with prospective contractual relations between Plaintiffs, their purported
customers and others.

Plaintiffs will be unable to establish a Fifth Amendment violation. There was never any
proceeding whereby the right was exercised. Refusing to cooperate in an investigation does not
give rise to a Fifth Amendment violation. Plaintiffs had no property right in remaining on the list
as a wrecker utilized by Genesee County therefore cannot show a due process violation cither.

Plaintiffs further cannot show that there was an interference with any contractual
relations. As such, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.

Il, STATEMENT OF FACTS
TOW PROVIDERS IN GENESEE COUNTY

The Plaintiffs, Ted Wright and Robert Petroff, worked for a towing company called
Roadside Assistance. Roadside Assistance was one of numerous towing companies within the
county.

The Genesee County Sheriff's Department provides enforcement services for many
townships including Vienna Township which is where the Plaintiffs' business was located.
(Exhibit 1 - Deposition of Christopher Swanson, p. 19). As a necessary part of conducting
business, the Genesee County Sheriff's Department at times required towing services for

vehicles, specifically where the owners do not request a particular towing company. Prior to
2:08-cv-11066-SFC-VMM Doc#20 Filed 01/12/09 Pg9of27 PgID 334

September 30, 2001, the agreement for enforcement services required that the department utilize
companies located principally within Vienna Township. (see Exhibit 2 - Enforcement
Agreement, p. 8, (15). Subsequent enforcement services agreements between Vienna Township
and the Sheriff's Department included no such requirement, and in 2005 Vienna Township gave
the Sheriff's Department sole discretion as to who could be used as a towing provider.

The Sheriff's Department had a protocol for contacting towing companies in townships
.- where they were providing enforcement services. (Exhibit | - Capt. Swanson's-deposition, p.
24). The dispatcher would contact a towing company, where one was necessary, based on an
initial request from the deputy at the scene. Otherwise, the towing companies were contacted
based on criteria put out by the Sheriff's Department and based on a preference list. (see Exhibit
3 - Memorandum Regarding Towing Companies Dated May 9, 2003).

From 2001 until-2005 Roadside Assistance was the primary towing company in Vienna
Township. In late 2005, another company, Leonard's Towing, requested to be placed in the
rotation for the Vienna Township tows. Thus, there were two companies, including the
Plaintiffs, that were competing for the same area or within a common jurisdiction. (Exhibit 1 -
Swanson Deposition, p. 27).

Leonard's Towing had applied to the Sheriff's Department with all the necessary criteria
and as of December 21, 2005 was put on the list such that it would alternate tows with the
Plaintiffs' company. (see Exhibit 4 -Memorandum dated 12-21-05).

THE DISPUTE
From the day Leonard's Towing was put on the dispatch list for Vienna Township, there

arose an ongoing feud between the owners of Leonard's Towing and the Plaintiffs.

 

 
2:08-cv-11066-SFC-VMM Doc#20 Filed 01/12/09 Pgi100f27 PgID335

There was no contract with any of the tow companies and it was always the discretion of
the Sheriff's Department as to who would be on the list. (Exhibit 1 - Swanson Deposition, p.
37). Instead of using just one preferred company within Vienna Township at that point in time,
it was decided to alternate between towing companies to keep it "fair." (Exhibit 1 - Swanson
deposition, p. 38).'

In May of 2006, because of the ongoing feud between Roadside and Leonard's,
concerning the alternating towing, Capt. Swanson drafted an express policy concerning wreckers.
providing services within Genesee County. (see Exhibit 5- Wrecker Dispatch Policy). Capt.
Swanson explained that the reason for preparing such a policy resulted from the "bitter battle"
between Roadside and Leonard's Towing. (see Exhibit 1 - Swanson deposition, p. 40). In
fact, it was the only township which presented a problem within the county because of these two
companies."

The Wrecker Dispatch Policy was something with which all tow companies within the
county had to comply. The Wrecker Dispatch Policy included some important provisions:

This policy outlines standards, operational procedures and documentation that are

required of wrecker (vehicle towing) services which are included in this office's

no preference call list. Including are guidelines to provide for the efficient and

equitable delivery of qualified and courteous towing services to protect the safety
of people and property.

 

" If the Sheriff's Department had maintained one preferred towing company, in light of Leonard's Towing
requesting to be put on the list, then the Sheriff's Department would certainly have been faced with another
lawsuit claiming there was an arbitrary and capricious decision regarding which tow company was preferred.

* The Wrecker Dispatch Policy is very similar to that which had already been set up by the Michigan State Policy
Central Dispatch No Preference List and which required towing companies to comply with certain requirements in
order to be on the No Preference List.
