INTRODUCTION

2

On February 13, 2008, this Court entered an Order appointing Gwyn Jones as Lead Plaintiff

3

and approving his selection of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP and Kahn Gauthier Swick, LLC

4
5

as Co-Lead Counsel (“Order”). (Dkt. No. 52). In that Order the Court directed that Lead Counsel
“shall have authority to speak for plaintiffs in matters regarding pretrial and trial procedure and

6
7
8
9

settlement negotiations … No motion, request for discovery or other pretrial proceedings shall be
initiated or filed by plaintiffs except through co-lead counsel.” Order at 16. In an apparent end run
around this Court’s Order, plaintiff James Wiltjer (“Wiltjer”) now seeks remand to San Francisco

10

Superior Court of his nearly identical complaint alleging violations of federal securities laws. Lead

11

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny the motion to remand.

13

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On October 3, 2007, the first-filed case against BigBand Networks Inc. was filed before this

14
Court. Mohanty v. BigBand Networks, Inc., Case No. 07-cv-5101-SBA. On October 5, 2007,
15
16

counsel for Wiltjer filed a case on behalf of Ellen Brodsky. See Brodsky v. BigBand Networks,

17

Inc., Case No. 07-cv-5141-MMC. Counsel for Ms. Brodsky voluntarily dismissed that complaint.

18

On December 3, 2007, two movants filed motions seeking to be appointed as Lead Plaintiff in the

19

above captioned cases.

20
21

That same day, rather than moving to be appointed Lead Plaintiff, counsel for Brodsky
opted to file a nearly identical complaint in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of Wiltjer.

22
On January 2, 2008, Defendants removed Wiltjer’s complaint to the United States District Court
23
24

for the Northern District of California and on January 18, 2008, Wiltjer moved to remand the case.

25

On February 13, 2008, the Court entered its Order appointing Gwyn Jones as Lead Plaintiff and

26

approving of his selection of Lead Counsel. On February 19, 2008, Wiltjer filed a Corrected

Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion and Motion to Remand. Defendants oppose the motion to remand and

ARGUMENT
In 1998, Congress enacted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (“SLUSA”).
SLUSA, Pub. L. 105-353 112 Stat. 3227. Prior to SLUSA, cases filed in State Court alleging

6
7
8
9

claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) were not removable. See Brody v.
Homestore, 240 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 1123 (C.D. Cal. 2003). SLUSA made federal court the
exclusive venue for class actions alleging fraud in the sale of certain securities and expanded

10

federal jurisdiction over certain class actions. Carpenters Pension Trust For Southern California

11

v. Ebbers, 299 B.R. 610, 614 (C.D. Cal. 2003). Indeed, the legislative history of SLUSA reveals

12

that the premise of this legislation is simple: lawsuits alleging violations that involve securities that

13
are offered nationally belong to Federal court.” 144 Cong. Rec. H11019-01, H11020
14
15
16
17
18
19

(1998)(Comments of representative Biley). SLUSA amended the jurisdictional provisions of the
Securities Act as follows:
The district courts of the United States and the United States courts
of any territory shall have jurisdiction … concurrent with State and
Territorial courts, except as provided in 77p of this title with respect
to covered class actions, of all suits in equity and actions at law
brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter.

20

15 U.S.C. § 77v(a). Thus, SLUSA divests state courts of concurrent jurisdiction over “covered

21

class actions” In re King Pharms., Inc., 230 F.R.D. 503, 505 (E.D. Tenn. 2004) (reasoning that

22

although inartfully worded, SLUSA is intended to permit removal of cases alleging violations of

23

the Securities Act).

24
Section 77p(f) defines “covered class actions” as those lawsuits where 1) plaintiff seeks to
25
26

represent a class of greater than 50 members; and 2) common questions of law and fact

27

predominate over questions affecting only individual prospective class members. 15 U.S.C.

28

§ 77p(f)(2). Section 77p(c) explicitly allows “removal of covered class actions”:

Any covered class action brought in any State court involving a
covered security as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, shall be
removable to the Federal district court for the district in which the
action is pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this
section.

4

15 U.S.C. § 77p(c). Here, Wiltjer filed a covered class action alleging violations of the Securities

5

Act. Wiltjer’s complaint purports to be on behalf of the identical class of shareholders represented

2

6
7

by Lead Plaintiff Gwyn Jones. The wrongful conduct that is the subject of the Wiltjer complaint is
the identical wrongful conduct that is the subject of the consolidated cases already pending before

8
9
10

this Court. In King Pharmaceuticals, the court refused to remand a securities case to state court
because remand “could lead to considerable confusion if not outright inconsistent results.” King

11

Pharmaceuticals, 230 F.R.D. at 505; see also In re Bank of America Sec. Litig., 95 F. Supp. 2d

12

1044 (E.D. Mo. 2000) (enjoining prosecution of a securities case in state court under All Writs Act

13

after securities case remanded from federal court in order to maintain control of litigation in federal

14

court). Similarly, remanding the Wiltjer case to the San Francisco Superior Court could lead to

15
considerable confusion, inconsistent results and needless expenditure of judicial resources.
16
17

Accordingly, Lead Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny Wiltjer’s motion to remand

18

and consolidate the Wiltjer action into the previously consolidated cases.
