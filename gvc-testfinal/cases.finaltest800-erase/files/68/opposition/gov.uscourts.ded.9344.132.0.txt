Guardian opposes the Motions to Stay this case filed by Dell, Gateway, and Lite-
On (collectively, "the Movants") because, contrary to the Movants' assertions, the LCD
module manufacturers cannot provide all the information and relief to which Guardian is
entitled. The Movants are carrying out activities in the United States that are accused of
infringement, and as direct infringers, the information they have and relief they can
provide is key to Guardian's ability to enforce its patents. A stay would not simplify the
issues before the Court, but rather would complicate the discovery process and unduly
prejudice Guardian's attempt to obtain full recovery for infringement of its patents.

BACKGROUND

Guardian filed this suit on January 19, 2005 and later added several parties by
amendment, naming 33 defendants in total. (D.I. 1, 50.) Many of the defendants are
related companies, such that a total of 19 "defendant groups" were named as parties to
this action. Four defendant groups, both LCD module manufacturers and original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), have already settled and taken licenses to
Guardian's patents, leaving a total of 15 defendant groups in this case. As of June 20,
2005, seven of the eleven "non-manufacturing" defendant groups remaining in the case
have moved to stay the case against the "non-manufacturing" defendants, with two more
defendant groups expected to so move today. (D.I. 109, 111, 113, 114, 122, 125.) A

chart illustrating the defendant groups and their status can be found at Exhibit A.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 ~ Filed 06/21/2005 Page 5of 19

All defendants have been served,! and all but three defendant groups (Hannstar,
BOE HYDIS, and the TPV entities) have answered. BOE HYDIS, Hannstar and Quanta
have thus far reserved the right to challenge the personal jurisdiction of this Court over
them. (D.I. 70, 83, 89.) All three of these parties are LCD module manufacturers.

The patents-in-suit all relate to the use of retardation films to improve the viewing
angle of LCD monitors. Guardian asserted the same patents in this Court in C.A. No.
1:03-cv-00934-SLR, filed October 7, 2003 ("Guardian I'). That action was terminated
on February 28, 2005, after all 14 defendants (7 defendant groups) settled and took
licenses to the patents. No stay was entered in Guardian I, yet the litigation was resolved
without extensive discovery or expense before fact discovery had closed and before
expert discovery was conducted.

There are generally three stages in the LCD supply chain: (1) LCD module
manufacturers, which manufacture the LCD module, (2) OEMs, which incorporate the
LCD module into an LCD monitor, and (3) resellers, which sell the LCD monitor to
consumers. (D.I. 110 at 1; D.I. 112 at 3; Ex. B.) However, one company may have
operations at more than one stage of the supply chain; for example, Dell and Gateway
identify themselves as both OEMs and resellers. (D.I. 110 at 3; D.I. 112 at 3.) Also,
some of the defendants in different stages of the supply chain are related, such as
Chunghwa Picture Tubes ("CPT") and Tatung. (Ex. C.) Unlike Honeywell, Guardian

has named LCD module manufacturers and OEMs, as well as resellers, as defendants.

 

1 Guardian has been informed that AOC International ceased to be in the monitor business in

December 1997, and never sold LCD monitors. Guardian expects to stipulate to a dismissal
without prejudice of AOC International from this case.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 ~ Filed 06/21/2005 Page 6of 19

(See Ex. D at 25:8-21.) Guardian wants all LCD module manufacturers to remain in this
case, but in light of their potential challenges to personal jurisdiction, Guardian cannot be
certain that BOE HYDIS, Hannstar and Quanta will remain present.

The resellers are the driving force in the market, as they set the specifications and
create demand for their LCD monitors. (D.I. 112 at 4.) OEMs and LCD module
manufacturers respond by manufacturing monitors that meet the specifications required
by the resellers-a key requirement being wide viewing angles. (/d.) Although the
resellers may not specify the manner by which wide viewing angles are achieved, their
demand for this feature drives the use of the technology claimed in the patents-in-suit.

As Guardian told the Court and the Guardian I defendants, and as Guardian has
told the defendants in this case, the only retardation films that Guardian is aware are used
commercially in the LCD monitors at issue are Fuji Wide View films. (See Ex. E.)
Thus, the infringement issues for all parties and all accused products are largely the same.
As in this case, the defendants in. Guardian I were both LCD module manufacturers and
resellers. They raised trial management issues such as the need for and order of separate
trials during the scheduling discussions in that case. As a result, the Court in Guardian I
added to the Scheduling Order a Status Conference to be held shortly before trial, at
which time such trial management issues would be decided. (Ex. F J 3, Ex. G.)

A scheduling conference with the Court is scheduled for June 29, 2005. In the
current draft of the Proposed Scheduling Order, the parties have proposed that discovery
begin the first week of July 2005. The Proposed Scheduling Order also includes a Status

Conference roughly two months before the proposed trial date, as was added to the
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 ~ Filed 06/21/2005 Page 7 of 19

Scheduling Order in Guardian I, at which time trial management issues will be
determined. No party has objected to that Status Conference in this case. (Ex. F yen 7.)

ARGUMENT

The Motions to Stay should be denied because a stay will prejudice Guardian's
ability to get complete discovery and relief, without simplifying the issues in this case.
Staying this case would result in inefficiencies by complicating the discovery process and
increasing the likelihood of multiple trials.

Courts have the inherent power to manage their dockets, balancing the competing
interests of the courts, counsel, and litigants. Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S.
248, 254-55 (1936). The decision whether to stay this case is firmly within the discretion
of the Court. Argos v. Orthotec LLC, 304 F. Supp.2d 591, 598 (D. Del. 2004). To
determine whether a stay is appropriate, this Court should consider: (1) whether Guardian
will be unduly prejudiced or tactically disadvantaged by a stay; (2) whether the issues in
question and trial of the case will be simplified by a stay; and (3) whether discovery has
been completed and a trial date set. /d. "The party requesting a stay `must make out a
clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair
possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to some one else.'" Kahn v.
General Motors Corp., 889 F.2d 1078, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (quoting Landis, 299 U.S.
at 255). Guardian will be prejudiced by a stay, and the Movants have not shown clear
hardship or inequity. Accordingly, the Motions to Stay should be denied.

I. Guardian Will Be Prejudiced And Disadvantaged By A Stay.

The Movants argue that Guardian will not be prejudiced or disadvantaged by a
stay because it will get all the discovery and relief it needs from the LCD module

manufacturers. This is not the case. Guardian requires discovery from the Movants in

4
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 ~ Filed 06/21/2005 Page 8of 19

order to, among other things, identify the infringing LCD modules that are sold in the
U.S. The Movants are likely the only source of that information. Additionally, if
Guardian is successful but only the LCD module manufacturers are enjoined, Guardian
would be required to conduct continuing, piecemeal litigation in order to recover for the
Movants', and other "non-manufacturing" defendants', infringement.

A. Discovery Will Be Required From The Movants.

The Movants suggest that the OEMs and resellers in this case should be stayed
while the case against the LCD module manufacturers proceeds.? (D.I. 110 at 1; D.I. 112
at 1; DI. 113 at 2.) Yet in Guardian I, except for a small minority of direct sales, the
LCD module manufacturers asserted they did not know which of their accused products
reached the U.S. (Ex. F 4 4.) The LCD module manufacturers in this case, which are
Taiwanese and Korean corporations, may similarly argue that they sell LCD modules to
OEMs outside the U.S. and do not know which of their modules are then imported and
sold in the U.S. If all activity against the Movants is stayed, Guardian will be forced to
pursue costly and time-consuming international discovery against those foreign OEMs to
which the LCD modules are sold in order to determine which modules reach the U.S.

The Movants, on the other hand, can readily provide that information through
discovery. Dell and Gateway, for example, can readily identify the LCD monitors that
they sell in the U.S. And OEMs such as Lite-On can readily identify the LCD monitors
that they sell in the U.S. or to entities in the U.S. The Court should not stay the case

against OEMs and resellers that have information showing direct infringement, in favor

 

2 Guardian notes that not all OEM and reseller defendants have moved for a stay, and the OEMs

Acer and Compal have not indicated they intend to so move.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 ~ Filed 06/21/2005 Page 9of 19

of complicated, expensive, time-consuming international discovery from third parties.
As Judge Jordan said in the Honeywell case, the first front in the war is finding out "who
is doing the manufacturing and supplying for who and for what products." (Ex. D at
45:25-46:6 (stating plaintiffs will be allowed some discovery from all parties).) The
Movants know where their LCD monitors are sold and who supplied them. Guardian
needs discovery of that information.

B. A Stay Would Only Foster Additional Litigation and Reduce
Efficiency.

To provide Guardian full recovery for the infringement of its patents, the case
should proceed against all named parties. A stay as to resellers in favor of a suit against
the manufacturers is inappropriate where there may be additional suppliers of the
infringing products. See Kahn, 889 F.2d at 1082.

Here, Gateway and Lite-On admit that not all of their suppliers are named in this
lawsuit or licensed by Guardian. (D.I. 112, Ex. C 0x00A7 6 (stating the "vast majority", but not
all, of Gateway's suppliers were purchased from co-defendants or licensees); D.I. 113,
Ex. A 4 6 (naming as "other LCD suppliers" IBM Singapore and Fujitsu Microelectronics
Asia, among others).) Dell raises the possibility that "numerous LCD module
manufacturers" may be impleaded through third-party practice, but does not identify any
such LCD module manufacturer. (D.I. 110 at 4.) And there is no guarantee that there
will not be a new participant in the industry in the future, whether an LCD module
manufacturer or OEM. Guardian should not be required to pursue additional litigation in
the future against these unnamed and, in some cases, unknown entities when Dell,
Gateway, and Lite-On are in front of the Court now and can answer for their direct

infringement of Guardian's patents.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document132 Filed 06/21/2005 Page 10 of 19

In addition, LCD module manufacturers BOE HYDIS, Hannstar, and Quanta have
reserved the right to challenge the personal jurisdiction of this Court over them. (D.I. 70,
83, 89.) They have not, as Seiko Epson did in the Honeywell case, assured Guardian that
they will stand behind their products and customers. (See Ex. D at 16:21-17:2.) Again, it
does not make sense to require a second stage of litigation against the OEMs and resellers
should any of their suppliers not be captured by this litigation, when the direct infringers
of Guardian's patents are before the Court now. This is particularly true as the
infringement issues regarding the accused products are the same, as a result of their
ubiquitous use of Fuji Wide View films.

The named OEMs and resellers account for a large percentage of the unlicensed
U.S. LCD monitor market, and thus an injunction against those entities in addition to the
LCD module manufacturers provides relief to Guardian for a majority of the U.S. market.
Importantly, such an injunction would protect Guardian regardless of whether there are
new manufacturer or OEM entrants to the market, manufacturers or OEMs over which
this Court may lack jurisdiction, or unnamed OEMs. The impact is significant-
according to industry research group DisplaySearch, there are, for example, over 30
OEMs. (Ex. B.) Some of them are small enough that pursuit through additional lawsuits
would be inefficient and needlessly prejudicial to Guardian.

In the Honeywell case cited by the Movants, Judge Jordan noted that Honeywell
had focused its efforts solely on the "non-manufacturing" defendants, ignoring the LCD
module manufacturers. (Ex. D at 43:23-44:15.) Guardian has not done this. Rather,
Guardian has named both manufacturing and non-manufacturing parties in order to

efficiently protect its interests with minimal litigation. All of the defendants-not just the
