Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 Filed 06/07/2005 Page4of15

By this motion to stay, Dell Inc. ("Dell") seeks to simplify this case in the interest
of judicial and litigant economy. Like two other cases currently pending in this District,
Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique v. Dell Computer Corp., et al. ("CEA"), C.A. No.
03-484-KAJ, 2004 WL 1554382 (D. Del. May 13, 2004) (Ex. A hereto) and Honeywell
International, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc., et al. ("Honeywell"), C.A. No. 04-1338-KAJ,
slip op. (D. Del. May 18, 2005) (Ex. B hereto) this Action involves infringement
allegations against both manufacturers and customers of LCDs and LCD modules. And,
as stated by the Court in CEA and Honeywell, resolving the issues against the
manufacturers of the LCDs prior to proceeding against the customers "would surely
simplify this case." Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique, 2004 WL 1554382, at *3

Each of the patents currently being asserted by Guardian Industries Corporation
("Guardian") contain claims directed exclusively to various technical attributes of liquid
crystal displays ("LCD"). In general, Guardian has sued two classes of defendants in this
action; those who manufacture LCDs (and who thus best understand the technical
features of LCDs) and those who are merely direct or indirect customers of the LCD
manufacturers (and who thus know very little about the LCDs). Dell is a pure customer
of the LCDs that are accused of infringement. On the other hand, on information and
belief, Dell's LCD suppliers and co-defendants, AU Optronics ("AUO"), BenQ
Corporation ("Ben-Q"), Chunghwa Picture Tubes, LTD ("CPT"), Chi Mei
Optoelectronics ("CMO"), Hannstar Display Corporation ("Hannstar") and Quanta
Display, Inc. ("Quanta") are manufacturers of the accused LCDs. In addition, Lite-On
Technology Corporation ("Lite-On"), another co-defendant and a Dell supplier, is a

customer of the LCD manufacturers, and, similar to Dell, does not have the technical
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 Filed 06/07/2005 Page5of15

information regarding the features of the LCDs. In light of the subject matter of the
patents being asserted by Guardian, this case could be simplified and made more
manageable by proceeding first with the cases against the LCD manufacturers only.

I. NATURE AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

Plaintiff Guardian filed this Action in January, 2005 alleging infringement of
United States Patent No. 5,570,214, entitled "Normally White Twisted Nematic LCD
with Retardation Films on Opposite Sides of Liquid Crystal Material for Improved
Viewing Zone," United States Patent No. 5,694,187, entitled "LCD Including a Negative
Biaxial Retarder on Each Side of the Liquid Crystal Layer," United States Patent No.
6,226,065, entitled "Liquid Crystal Display Having High Contrast Viewing Zone
Centered in Positive or Negative Vertical Region," and United States Patent No.
6,229,588, entitled "Normally White LCD Including First and Second Biaxial Retarders"
(collectively "the patents-in-suit" or "the Guardian patents"), naming some twenty-two
(22) defendants (D.I. 1). On March 31, 2005, Guardian amended its complaint to add an
additional eleven (11) defendants for a total of thirty-three defendants (D.I. 50). This
Action ("Guardian II"), is the second action by Guardian alleging infringement of the
Guardian patents.' As of the filing of this Motion, a number of defendants have yet to
answer Guardian's Amended Complaint and at least one defendant, TPV Technology,
Ltd., has not been served.

Dell, along with other defendants, has been working to negotiate a proposed
scheduling order with Guardian and has conferred individually and collectively with

Guardian on several occasions. Given the volume of named defendants representing

 

! The initial action, C. A. No. 1:03-cv-00934-SLR ("Guardian I"), also before this Court,
included seventeen (17) defendants and was recently dismissed.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 Filed 06/07/2005 Page6of15

almost every stage within the LCD supply chain, Defendants' ability to negotiate an
acceptable scheduling order has proven to be a difficult task. A status conference is
scheduled for June 29, 2005. No discovery has been taken or requested. No trial dates
have been set.
IL. STATEMENT OF THE FACTS

Dell, like other customer defendants, e.g, Hewlett Packard, Gateway and Acer,
does not design or manufacture any LCDs or LCD modules. See Declaration of Mitchell
Markow ("Markow Decl."), 3-4, dated June 6, 2005 and attached as Ex. C hereto. Dell
simply purchases LCDs as components for Dell products or purchases products
containing LCDs as components. Each of the LCDs and LCD modules incorporated
within or sold as a Dell product are directly supplied to Dell by a party named in this
Action, Guardian I', or is an entity possessing and/or negotiating a license to the patents-
in-suit. Specifically, Dell's suppliers of LCDs and LCD modules for its products
includes AUO*, BenQ', CPT, CMO`, Hannstar, Lite-On, Quanta, Samsung Electronics',
Sharp Corporation', LG Phillips" and Hitachi Corporation'.

Given the number of defendants, the scope of the infringement allegations in
Guardian's complaint, and Guardian's failure to identify the specific "LCDs and related

products" accused of infringement, careful consideration should be given to how best to

 

* The following list of Dell suppliers (designated above by an "*") obtained a license to
ihe patents-in-suit in the Guardian I action: Samsung Electronics, Sharp Corporation, LG
Phillips and Hitachi Corporation.

3 Furthermore, Dell has recently learned that AUO and BenQ, two of Dell's suppliers in
the present Action, have obtained a license to the patents-in-suit.

* Yn a letter dated June 3, 2005, counsel for Guardian identified CMO as a licensed entity.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 ~ Filed 06/07/2005 Page/7of15

structure this Action to allow for a meaningful and manageable proceeding. To put the
complexity of this case into perspective, consider the following:

e Guardian named 33 defendants and Guardian broadly identified the
allegedly infringing products as including "LCDs and related
products"

e The potential number of LCD-containing products at issue which
have been manufactured and/or sold by defendants could well be in

the hundreds.

e In addition to the named defendants, there may be numerous LCD
manufacturers impleaded through third-party practice.

e Many of the named defendants, Dell included, know virtually

nothing concerning the pertinent aspects of the LCDs used in their
products making a defense against this action unworkable.

The foregoing facts cause this Action to be unmanageable. There are simply too
many defendants and too many products at issue.

Ill. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

Defendant Dell hereby moves this Court to stay the claims asserted against it by
Plaintiff Guardian -- such claims pertain to products supplied to Dell as a pure customer.
As detailed below, the resolution of Guardian's allegations of infringement against Dell,
and the other customer defendants, hinges on whether the LCD devices manufactured by
the LCD manufacturers infringe any valid and enforceable claim of the patents-in-suit.
As has been recognized in similar contexts, including CEA and Honeywell, the
determination of patent infringement claims against device manufacturers will, as a
practical matter, resolve the case against the customers. And, as was also recognized in
the CEA and Honeywell cases, it is the device manufacturers, who possess the technical
information, witnesses and documentation necessary to a defense, that are in the best

position to defend their products against claims of patent infringement. In stark contrast,
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 Filed 06/07/2005 Page 8of15

Dell and the other customer defendants have little if any knowledge concerning the
design, manufacture and operation of the accused LCD modules. Accordingly, Dell
respectfully requests that this Court stay further proceedings in this action against Dell
pending resolution of Plaintiff's case against Dell's suppliers.
IV. ARGUMENT

District courts possess broad, inherent authority to coordinate litigation matters as
part of their trial management function. Included within these broad powers is the
discretion to stay proceedings. Cheyney State College Faculty v. Hufstedler, 703 F.2d
732, 737-38 (3d Cir. 1983). In deciding whether to grant a stay district courts must
consider several factors including:

the possible damage, hardship and inequities to the parties to the lawsuit

and the relationship of the stay to the fulfillment of judicial objectives of
simplification of the issues in question and trial of the case.

See United Sweetener USA, Inc. v. NutraSweet Company, 766 F.Supp. 212, 217 (D. Del.
1991)(quoting United Merchants & Mfrs., Inc. v. Henderson, 495 F Supp. 444, 447 (N.D.
Ill. 1980); see also See e.g, Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique v. Dell Computer
Corp. et al, C.A. No. 03-484-KAJ, 2004 WL 1554382, at *2 (D. Del. May 13, 2004)
(identifying the following factors for consideration: (1) whether prejudice to the non-
moving party exists; (2) whether the stay would result in simplifying the issues of the
case; (3) whether discovery has been completed; and (4) whether a trial date has been set)
(Ex. A hereto); Honeywell International Inc., et al, v. Apple Computer, Inc., et al., C.A.
No. 04-1338-KAJ, slip op. at 6 (D. Del. May 18, 2005) (Ex. B hereto).

A. Staying the Case as to Dell Will Simplify the Proceedings

It cannot be disputed that fewer parties, fewer products and fewer attorneys will

simplify this Action. A stay with respect to the customer defendants, like Dell, will serve
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 Filed 06/07/2005 PageQof15

to streamline the litigation by permitting the parties having a "real interest" to focus on
the principal issues. This will likely lead to a shorter trial and, as a result, will lessen the
likelihood of jury confusion.

In addition, the determination of patent infringement claims against product
manufacturers will, as a practical matter, resolve the case against the users of the
manufactured products. See e.g., Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique, 2004 WL
1554382, at *2 (staying the case against customer defendants to "streamline the case and
avoid piecemeal litigation"). In CEA this Court, believing a stay would simplify the
issues for trial of the case, ordered a customer stay and stated:

[i]t is common practice to stay all pending [patent] litigation except the
first suit between the patent owner and a manufacturer or a higher level
supplier. Davip F. HERR, ANNOTATED MANUAL FOR COMPLEX
LITIGATION, 0x00A733.63 (3d ed. 2003); see also Katz v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 909
F.2d 1459, 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1990)("litigation against or brought by the
manufacturer of infringing goods takes precedence over a suit by the
patent owner against customers of the manufacturer"), Because the
manufacturers are intimately involved in the design, operation, and use of
the accused LCD panels, they are in the best position to contest the
validity and infringement of [Plaintiff's] asserted patents. Resolving these
issues prior to proceeding against the OEM/distributors and retailers
would surely simplify this case. If, for example, [Plaintiff's] patents were
found invalid or the manufacturers would found to be not infringing, then
there would be no need to proceed against the OEM/distributors or
retailers, thus conserving judicial resources and expense to the parties.

Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique, 2004 WL 1554382, at *3 (emphasis added).
Courts favor manufacturer suits over customer suits for some very practical
reasons. For example, most recently in the Honeywell case, the Court found that:

It is impracticable to try an infringement case against some 40 defendants
or third-party defendants with many different accused devices, and it is
unwise to attempt any such thing when liability depends exclusively upon
infringement being found as to an LCD component that the defendants do
not manufacture and when at least some of the manufacturers of the
LCDs are before the court and are willing to stand behind their products
in this litigation.
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document110 ~~ Filed 06/07/2005 Page 10 of 15

Honeywell v. Apple, C.A. No. 04-1338-KAJ, slip op. at 7 (emphasis added). The First
Circuit has stated that "in reality, the manufacturer is the true defendant in the customer
suit .... [I]t is a simple fact of life that a manufacturer must protect its customers, either
as a matter of contract, or good business, or in order to avoid the damaging impact of an
adverse ruling against its products." Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronics Corp., 553 F.2d
735, 737-38 (Ist Cir. 1977)(citations omitted), It is these manufacturers who have an
overriding interest in defending their products and who have the technical acumen to
defend against claims of patent infringement. Corning Glass Works v. U.S., 220 Ct. Cl.
605 (1979). On the other hand purchasers and users, like Dell, of the allegedly infringing
products possess little, if any, technical information concerning the design or
manufacture of the accused product. Nor does Dell have the ability to fully and
thoroughly address the substance of the claims raised by Guardian.

B. Guardian Will Not Be Prejudiced as a Result of the Stay

Guardian will not suffer prejudice were this Court to grant Dell's Motion to Stay
because the resolution of the allegations of infringement against Dell hinges on whether
the LCD devices manufactured and/or sold by Dell's suppliers infringe any valid
enforceable claim of the patents-in-suit. Each of these issues may be decided without
Dell's participation and are more properly directed toward Dell's direct suppliers. If
Dell's suppliers are absolved of infringement in this Action, claims against Dell
pertaining to those products must also be dismissed because Dell, as a recipient of non-
infringing products would not be subject to liability. In essence, any judgment declaring
non-infringement and/or invalidity of the patents-in-suit in favor of Dell's suppliers

would similarly extend to Dell.
