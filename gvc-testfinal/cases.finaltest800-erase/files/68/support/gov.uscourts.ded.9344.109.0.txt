JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

DELL INC.'s MOTION TO STAY PENDING RESOLUTION OF
THE CASES AGAINST LCD MODULE MANUFACTURERS
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document109 ~ Filed 06/07/2005 Page2of5

Defendant Dell Inc. ("Dell"), as a pure customer of allegedly infringing liquid
crystal display ("LCD") products, respectfully moves this Court to enter an Order staying
the above-captioned action against Dell pending the final resolution of Plaintiff Guardian
Industries Corporation's ("Guardian") claims against the LCD product manufacturers in
this action. As a pure customer of allegedly infringing products Dell has no technical
information regarding the design and/or manufacture of such products, nor does Dell
have the ability to address fully and thoroughly the substance of the claims raised by
Guardian. Rather, it is the LCD product manufacturers who have an overriding interest
in defending their products and who have the technical and factual information necessary
to defend against Guardian's claims of patent infringement. As recognized in two other
cases pending in this District, Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique v. Dell Computer
Corp., et al. ("CEA"), C.A. No. 03-484-KAJ, 2004 WL 1554382 (D. Del. May 13, 2004)
(Ex. A hereto) and Honeywell International, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc., et al.
("Honeywell"), C.A. No. 04-1338-KAJ, slip op. (D. Del. May 18, 2005) (Ex. B hereto)
staying the case against the customer defendants and proceeding against the LCD
manufacturers will greatly simplify this case and make better use of valuable judicial and
litigant resources.

The grounds for this Motion are set forth in Dell Inc.'s accompanying
Memorandum in Support of Dell Inc.'s Motion to Stay Further Proceedings in this

Action. A proposed Order granting Deil's Motion is attached as Ex. C hereto.
