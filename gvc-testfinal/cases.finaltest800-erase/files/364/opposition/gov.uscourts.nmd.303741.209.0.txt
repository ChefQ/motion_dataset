CRIMINAL NO. 14-2783 JB

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR RELEASE
PENDING APPEAL (Doc. 195)
The United States submits the following response to Defendant’s Motion for Release
Pending Appeal (Doc. 195), and requests that this Court deny the motion without hearing or
testimony.
INTRODUCTION
A violent offender “shall” be detained pending appeal. 18 U.S.C. § 1343(b)(2). The only
exception to mandatory detention is where the defendant can satisfy the threshold requirements
of 18 U.S.C. § 1343(b)(1) and make a “clear showing of exceptional reasons why his detention
would not be appropriate.” 18 U.S.C. § 1345(c); United States v. Koon, 6 F.3d 561, 564 (9th Cir.
1993); United States v. Jager, 2011 WL 831279 at 18 (D.N.M.). Here, Defendant cannot meet
all of the threshold requirements of Section 1343(b)(1). Even if there is clear and convincing
evidence that he poses no danger or flight risk, Defendant does not raise a “substantial question
of law or fact likely to result in reversal” as required under Section 1343(b)(1)B)(i).
Furthermore, Defendant cannot clearly show that there are exceptional reasons why his detention
is not appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 1345(c).

DISCUSSION
1.

Defendant has failed to identify a substantial question of law or fact likely to result
in reversal.
A.

Introduction of other-act testimony

At the outset, Defendant fails to properly articulate a substantial question. As phrased,
Defendant claims that the “question” is: “the admission of evidence concerning three other
incidents under Rule 404(b), combined with the prosecution’s misuse of that evidence in closing
argument.” Doc. 195 at 1, 3. In that phrase, Defendant describes two events but no questions.
He does so in order to edit the standard of review out of the analysis – an incorrect approach. In
United States v. Affleck, the Tenth Circuit noted, “Of course, a ‘substantial’ question must be one
which can be properly raised on appeal.” United States v. Affleck, 765 F.2d 944, 952 n.13 (10th
Cir. 1985) (en banc). An event cannot be raised on appeal. The Tenth Circuit confronted an
identical situation in United States v. Farr, 457 F. App’x 757 (10th Cir. 2012) (unpublished). In
that case, the defendant challenged the introduction of evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) at trial
and requested bail pending appeal. Id. at 758-59. The Tenth Circuit immediately noted the
applicable standard of review (abuse of discretion) and phrased the question as “whether the
district court abused its discretion in admitting the 404(b) evidence,” which aptly describes the
question in this case as well. Id.
Proper inclusion of the standard of review in the question is dispositive. There can be no
question that this Court acted well within its discretion. Under the abuse of discretion standard, a
reviewing court “will not reverse a district court’s ruling if it falls within the bounds of
permissible choice in the circumstances and is not arbitrary, capricious or whimsical.” United
States v. Mares, 441 F.3d 1152, 1156 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks, citation and alteration
omitted). This Court methodically considered each of the parties’ arguments on this issue and
2

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 3 of 15

the applicable law. See Doc. 93. The Court made each of its rulings clearly, carefully and
intelligently. Id. The United States respectfully submits that there is no way that a reviewing
court could characterize this Court’s 38-page opinion as “arbitrary, capricious or whimsical.”
In Farr, 457 F. App’x at 759, the Tenth Circuit held that because the district court had
correctly noted that the government had the burden of proving that the defendant acted willfully,
there was no “substantial question” whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting
evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b). In this case too, the Court based its decision to admit the
evidence in part on the fact that the charges required proof that the Defendant acted willfully.
See Doc. 93, pp. 27-28.
Notably, Defendant does not cite a single case in which a court has found that a 404(b)
ruling raises a substantial question for § 3143(b)(2) purposes. In fact, while recognizing that
there are no “blanket categories,” rulings on evidence normally are not “substantial questions”
because they are ordinary questions. Every trial involves dozens or even hundreds of factspecific rulings regarding the introduction of evidence. Rule 403 requires a balancing analysis of
the relative probative value and prejudicial effect of each piece of evidence. In almost every
trial, reasonable judges could differ about one or more of the evidentiary rulings. But “[i]t is not
sufficient to show simply that reasonable judges could differ (presumably every judge who
writes a dissenting opinion is still ‘reasonable’) or that the issue is fairly debatable or not
frivolous.” United States v. Powell, 761 F.2d 1227, 1233 (8th Cir. 1985) (cited in United States
v. Pancal, 999 F.2d 548 (10th Cir. 1993) (unpublished)). The exception would quickly swallow
the rule if discretionary decisions during trial were considered “substantial questions.”
A review of case law reveals that it would be highly unusual for a district court to release
a defendant on bail pending appeal when the proffered substantial question is one that the

3

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 4 of 15

appellate court would review for abuse of discretion or plain error. Certainly, Defendant cites no
such case from within the Tenth Circuit or otherwise. The United States has tried to locate such
a case without success. In contrast, each of the Tenth Circuit cases the United States has located
that affirm or require release pending appeal involves a legal question subject to de novo review.
See, e.g., United States v. Frownfelter, 363 F. App’x 675 (10th Cir. 2010) (unpublished)
(involving whether a certain offense was a felony or a misdemeanor); United States v.
Ensminger, 166 F.3d 348 (10th Cir. 1998) (involving application of a sentencing enhancement).
Defendant’s attempt to characterize the Court’s discretionary decision to admit the otheract evidence as a “substantial question” amounts to little more than second-guessing the Court’s
pre-trial ruling. Prior to trial, both parties briefed and argued the admission of testimony of the
other motorists. See Docs. 35, 46, 56. The United States hereby incorporates its written and oral
arguments made previously in support of this testimony. This Court issued and explained its
ruling in a 38-page memorandum. See Doc. 93. In reaching its opinion, this Court was fully
cognizant of all the considerations and concerns that Defendant returns to here. Defendant
perhaps rephrases his objections to the evidence; but this Court made its decision on the
substance of the issues, and need not reconsider now.
In the instant Motion, Defendant raises no new argument supporting exclusion of the
testimony of the other motorists. But his restated arguments create the slanted impression that
Rule 404(b) excludes all evidence that shows propensity. As this Court knows well, that is not
the law. See Doc. 93, p. 20-21. “[W]hen other-act evidence is admitted for a proper purpose and
is relevant, it may be admissible even though it has ‘the potential impermissible side effect of
allowing the jury to infer criminal propensity.’” United States v. Moran, 503 F.3d 1135, 1145
(10th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). See also United States v. Romero, No. CR 09-1253 JB, 2011

4

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 5 of 15

WL 1103862, at *12 (D.N.M.) (Browning, J.) (“Rule 404(b) evidence almost always has some
propensity evidence.”). The Tenth Circuit has explained precisely the role that propensity plays
in the admissibility of other-act evidence:
We acknowledge that there is sometimes a fine line between what constitutes
forbidden propensity evidence and what constitutes legitimate evidence of intent
and that the permissible use of prior convictions to prove intent might have “the
potential impermissible side effect of allowing the jury to infer criminal
propensity.” See United States v. Macedo, 371 F.3d 957, 966 (7th Cir. 2004). We
are satisfied, however, that when the four Huddleston factors are satisfied, the
evidence is properly admitted.
United States v. Cherry, 433 F.3d 698, 701 n.3 (10th Cir. 2005). But incredibly, in his challenge
to the admission of other-act evidence, Defendant never once mentions the Huddleston test. See
generally Doc. 195. His argument depends on grafting an additional prong – that the evidence
carry no possible propensity inference – onto the established test for admission of other-act
evidence. See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 691-92 (1988). Defendant’s project of
replacing the approved proper purposes with the word “propensity” proves nothing relevant to
the existing law, and does not convert the Court’s reasoned prior opinion into a “substantial
question.”
Besides the misapprehension of controlling law, the only new feature of Defendant’s
renewed objection to the other-act evidence is that, with the benefit of hindsight, it is now
possible to retrospectively review which issues were contested at trial. The problem is that
Defendant never raised this issue during trial. During closing arguments, Defendant did not
attempt to parse out which issues had been contested, nor did he ask to revisit the Court’s ruling
regarding the proper uses of the other-act evidence. See Trial T. at 1062-69. In fact, Defendant
went through each proffered purpose and asked for each to be put before the jury so that
Defendant could rebut or comment on them in his closing argument. Id. at 1062-63. The Court
obliged by ordering the United States to clearly argue the proper purposes prior to Defendant’s
5

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 6 of 15

closing, and the United States complied. Id. at 1063-69. So, rather than take the position that the
United States could only argue certain purposes based on the evidence presented, Defendant
made the tactical trial decision that he wanted the United States to present all the proffered
purposes to the jury so that Defendant could critique them. This Court gave him what he
requested, and he cannot complain that it presents a “substantial question” now.
But presenting a substantial question is only half the battle under Section 3143(b)(1)(B).
Defendant also has the burden to prove by a preponderance of evidence that “if that substantial
question is determined favorably to defendant on appeal, that decision is likely to result in
reversal or an order for a new trial[.]” Affleck, 765 F.2d at 953 (emphasis added). In this
context, “likely” does not mean such an outcome is merely possible, it means that the outcome is
“more likely to happen than not.” United States v. Powell, 761 F.2d 1227, 1233 (8th Cir. 1985)
(cited with approval in United States v. Pancal, 999 F.2d 548 (10th Cir. 1993) (unpublished).
See also United States v. Valera-Elizondo, 761 F.2d 1020, 1024-25 n.7 (5th Cir. 1985). Put
another way, “harmless errors, errors that have no prejudicial effect, or errors that have been
insufficiently preserved would not justify a court’s granting bail.” United States v. Bilanzich,
771 F.2d 292, 299 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing United States v. Miller, 753 F.2d 19, 23 (3rd Cir.
1985). See also United States v. Bayko, 774 F.2d 516, 522 (1st Cir. 1985).
In this case, if the reviewing court resolves the 404(b) issue favorably to Defendant, the
court next will apply the “nonconstitutional harmless error standard.” See United States v.
Jefferson, 925 F.2d 1242, 1255 (10th Cir. 1991). The court will only reverse or order a new trial
if the improperly admitted evidence had a “substantial influence” on the outcome at trial or
generates a “grave doubt” as to whether it had such effect. Id. In making this assessment, the
appellate court will review the entire record, “examining the context, timing, and use of the

6

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 7 of 15

erroneously admitted evidence at trial and how it compares to properly admitted evidence.”
United States v. Blechman, 657 F.3d 1052, 1067 (10th Cir. 2011).
Defendant does not meet his burden to show that a reviewing court would probably
reverse or remand for new trial because he does not even attempt to compare the other-acts
material to the volume of uncontested evidence at trial. His argument on this point is only one
paragraph. See Doc. 195 at 17-18. He does not acknowledge even the existence of any properly
admitted evidence against him. He does not attempt to explain what the defense theory at trial
was, nor how the other-acts testimony might have impacted that theory. Admittedly, the defense
theory of the case is unclear from the closing argument; but that is Defendant’s problem. The
United States will not attempt to clarify except to say that Defendant asked the jury to believe
Thomas Rodella, Jr.’s testimony over Michael Tafoya’s account. Tafoya testified extremely
credibly, while Rodella, Jr. was effectively impeached on multiple levels. In fact, Defendant
already conceded that the United States “was successful in undermining Mr. Rodella, Jr.’s
credibility with the use of his medical records and psychiatric testimony.” Doc. 160, p. 4. This
Court noted further that “the United States impeached Rodella, Jr. on a number of issues outside
the medical records. . . . Rodella, Jr.’s credibility suffered more damage from the rest of the
United States’ cross-examination than from the United States’ use of his medical records.” Doc.
182, p. 63. Additionally, this Court already has recognized that, besides Rodella, Jr.’s credibility
problems and the 404(b) evidence, several other factors contributed significantly to the
conviction, including “Tafoya’s testimony, the testimony of the jogger who saw the car chase,
[and] Lieutenant Sanches’ testimony[.]” Id. at 64. And the jury found beyond a reasonable
doubt that Defendant brandished a firearm, despite the fact that each of the three other motorists
testified that Defendant did not brandish a firearm at them.

7

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 8 of 15

Defendant does not address any of these issues. But Affleck requires him to prove, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that a reviewing court will probably not find the supposed error
to be harmless. Affleck, 965 F.2d at 953; Powell, 761 F.2d at 1233. He has not embraced this
burden and this Court should not make his argument for him.
B.

Closing argument

The second situation that Defendant references as a question is “the prosecution’s misuse
of that evidence in closing argument.” Doc. 195 at 1, 3. Once again, inclusion of the standard of
review is dispositive. The standard of review is plain error. See United States v. Taylor, 514
F.3d 1092, 1097 (10th Cir. 2008) (applying plain error review when a defendant objected to a
prosecutor’s argument but did not object to the district court’s curative instruction). At the end
of the first part of the United States’ closing argument, Defendant objected. See Trial T. 106263. The Court ruled that the United States must immediately explain to the jury the exclusive
purposes for which they could use the evidence regarding the three other motorists. Id. at 106365. The United States complied with the Court’s ruling by arguing to the jury that they may
consider the evidence only for the permitted purposes. Id. at 1067-69. Defendant did not object
to the Court’s resolution of the 404(b) objection. Id. at 1063-67. Nor did Defendant object
following the United States’ curative argument on permitted purposes. Id. at 1069. Nor did
Defendant object when the United States discussed the other motorists in rebuttal. Id. at 112833. Nor did he object at the conclusion of the United States’ argument. Id. at 1134-35. In short,
the record indicates that Defendant was entirely satisfied with the Court’s ruling and the United
States’ curative argument, and untroubled by the rebuttal argument. Defendant gave the Court
no further opportunity to address the 404(b) issue. In such a situation, the Court’s ruling will be
reviewed only for plain error. See Taylor, 514 F.3d at 1097. Therefore, the second question,

8

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 9 of 15

properly phrased, is “whether the district court committed plain error in failing sua sponte to
issue a limiting instruction.”
“Plain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects the
defendant’s substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public
reputation of judicial proceedings.” United States v. Baldridge, 559 F.3d 1126, 1135 (10th Cir.
2009) (citations omitted). When conducting plain error review of allegedly improper remarks of
counsel, courts “must view the remarks in the context of the entire trial.” Baldridge, 559 F. 3d at
1135 (quoting United States v. Oberle, 136 F.3d 1414, 1421 (10th Cir. 1998)).
But again, Defendant fails to assume the burden of proving that, in the context of the
entire trial, a reviewing court will probably reverse or remand for a new trial. He cites no case
finding that a district court committed a “plain error” in this context, let alone a case reversing a
conviction for such a reason. Each of the three cases Defendant cites involves a preserved,
contemporaneous objection and review for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Simpson,
479 F.3d 492, 503 (7th Cir. 2007); United States v. Richards, 719 F.3d 746, 764 (7th Cir. 2013);
United States v. Brown, 327 F.3d 867, 871 (9th Cir. 2003). And those cases involve egregious
conduct that cannot be compared to the facts of this case. In Simpson, the prosecutor “explicitly
told the jurors to draw the inference that Simpson had done so many drug deals in the past that
he could not remember doing this one.” Simpson, 479 F.3d at 505. Likewise, in Richards, the
prosecutor told the jury “the defendant is a drug dealer” at least half a dozen times during
argument. Richards, 719 F.3d at 764-65. In short, Defendant offers no comparable case
involving reversal upon plain error review. As shown above, the reviewing court will probably
find any errors to be harmless. Defendant’s burden is even heavier as it pertains to plain error
review, but once again he has not undertaken to meet that burden.

9

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 10 of 15

2.

Defendant cannot show exceptional reasons to justify the defendant’s release
pending appeal.
Even if Defendant could meet the threshold requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 1343(b)(1),

he may only be released if “it is clearly shown that there are exceptional reasons why [his]
detention would not be appropriate.” 18 U.S.C.§ 1345(c). Exceptional reasons are those that are
out of the ordinary, uncommon, rare or of the sort that “present a unique set of circumstances.”
United States v. Wages, 271 F. App’x 726, 727 (10th Cir. 2008) (and cases cited therein).
Defendant offers five reasons that he claims satisfy Section 1345(c). He relies heavily on United
States v. Garcia, 340 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2003), to argue that his five reasons are exceptional. A
careful examination of that opinion, rather than reliance on Defendant’s selected quotes, reveals
that Garcia provides little support for Defendant’s arguments. In fact, taken singly or in
combination, Defendant’s reasons are not clearly exceptional. Consequently, release pending
appeal is not justified.
First, Defendant quotes Garcia to argue that he has “an unusually strong chance [of]
obtaining a reversal of his conviction on appeal.” Doc. 195 at 19. However, Defendant fails to
mention what appellate issues the Garcia court would consider as having an “unusually strong
chance.” One example described in that opinion is when there is a “distinct possibility that the
convictions of those offenders would ultimately be overturned on the ground that the retroactive
extension of an expired statute of limitations is unconstitutional.” Id. at 1021. Another example
of an “unusually strong chance” is when the issues on appeal have not previously been decided
by the appellate court. Id. These examples are easily distinguishable from the issue Defendant
identifies as a substantial question in the instant case. The admission and use of Rule 404(b)
evidence does not present a Constitutional question. And, as discussed infra, the Tenth Circuit
has repeatedly decided Rule 404(b) issues.
10

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 11 of 15

Second, Defendant relies on Garcia to argue that his poor health constitutes an
exceptional reason. However, the Garcia court actually held that “a severely ill or injured
defendant might have exceptional reasons….” Id. at 1019 (emphasis added). Defendant
Rodella’s health issues are not “severe” as was evidenced by the fact that (1) he physically
attacked the victim, and (2) considered himself sufficiently healthy to run for a second four-year
term as sheriff. Furthermore, he has experienced no treatment difficulties while detained at the
Torrance County Detention Facility. The defendant’s treating nurse practitioner reports that the
defendant does not have “significant medical needs” as suggested in Defendant’s motion. See
attached email from Jay Peterson, CFNP, attached hereto as Exhibit 1. Defendant also claims in
his motion that his health problems have worsened since his incarceration. Doc. 195 at 19. To
the contrary, the defendant’s “health care needs have improved” since his arrival at Torrance
County Detention Facility. Exhibit 1.
The Tenth Circuit noted that “it is a rare case in which health conditions present an
‘exceptional reason.’” Wages, 271 F. App’x at 728 (reasons put forth that the defendant is 53
years old, wheelchair-bound, requires a special mattress, and has a hearing impairment are not
exceptional). “Chronic medical condition controlled by medication is generally not an
exceptional reason justifying release.” United States v. Varney, 2013 WL 2406256 at 1-2 (E.D.
Ky.) (defendant’s medical condition requiring 24-hour oxygen and various medications not
exceptional). According to Nurse Practitioner Jay Peterson, the defendant is no longer exhibiting
symptoms of hemochromatosis. Exhibit 1. This means that the Defendant is not even suffering
from a chronic medical condition at this time. Accordingly, his health condition cannot possibly
be sufficiently rare to present an exceptional reason.

11

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 12 of 15

Third, Defendant relies on Garcia to argue that the “nature of the violent act itself”
constitutes an exceptional reason for his release. Doc. 195 at 19, quoting Garcia. Once again,
the defendant fails to mention what the Garcia court would consider as exceptional. The two
examples the court describe clearly bear no relation to the instant case. The first example is
where “the act was violent, but did not involve any specific intent or if it did not involve any
threat or injury to persons….” Garcia, 340 F.3d at 1019. In contrast, a violation of 18 U.S.C.
§242 involves specific intent and the defendant’s high-speed chase and assault with a firearm
clearly involved a threat to persons. The second example is where the circumstances
surrounding the act of violence were “highly unusual” such as an elderly man’s mercy killing of
his ailing wife. Id. at 1018-19. Unfortunately, the violation of a person’s Constitutional rights
under color of law is not highly unusual.
Defendant also argues that since he no longer is a law enforcement officer, he presents a
low risk of future violence. Since the risk of danger is considered in the threshold analysis under
18 U.S.C. §3143(b)(1), it should not enter into the 3145(c) analysis. Also, Defendant relies on
Garcia to claim that since his status is such that he can no longer pose a threat, he is “not the
type of violent person for whom congress intended mandatory detention….” Doc. 195 at 20
(quoting Garcia, 340 F.3d at 1019). But, the type of violent person Garcia meant is a defendant
who “may have acted violently but uncharacteristically, in reaction to an unusually provocative
circumstance.” Garcia, 340 F.3d at 1019. In committing the instant offense, the defendant
certainly was not reacting to an “unusually provocative circumstance.”
Fourth, Defendant’s status as a former law enforcement officer does not present an
exceptional reason. In fact, his status is common, rather than exceptional, in civil rights offenses.
As Judge Rymer noted in his concurring opinion, Defendant’s status is “an ordinary corollary of

12

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 13 of 15

being a law enforcement officer convicted of violating another’s civil rights under 18 U.S.C.
§ 242.” Koon, 6 F.3d at 563. That is, he will not face a risk that is not faced by any other former
law enforcement officer convicted of the same offense. And there is no indication that “either
Congress or the Sentencing Commission intended to shield law enforcement officers as a group
from the otherwise universally applicable effects of incarceration on convicted criminals.”
United States v. Rybicki, 96 F.3d 754, 759 (4th Cir. 1996).
Defendant’s reliance on the dissent in Koon is misplaced because the facts in Koon are
easily distinguishable. As the Supreme Court noted, the case received “extraordinary notoriety
and national media coverage” arising out of the beating of Rodney King. Koon v. United States,
518 U.S. 81, 112 (1996); United States v. Mills, 194 F.3d 1108, 1115 (10th Cir. 1999) (Koon
involved “a unique combination of factors”); United States v. Winters, 174 F.3d 478, 485 (5th
Cir. 1999) (“Koons was an extreme case”). In the instant case, Defendant’s circumstances are
neither extreme nor unique.
Moreover, Detention Management Inspector Mitch Varley states that Defendant has
never made an official complaint of any threats. The defendant only mentioned threats after his
motion for release pending appeal was filed and upon Mr. Varley’s inquiry. Furthermore, the
defendant is under administrative segregation status where he is securely housed alone and
checked every 30 minutes. See email from Mr. Varley, attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
Fifth, Defendant’s family circumstances certainly are not exceptional. In any event,
personal and family hardships ordinarily do not constitute exceptional reasons under 18 U.S.C.
§ 134(c). See United States v. Velarde, 555 F. App’x 840 (10th Cir. 2014) (personal and family
concerns are not exceptional reasons under 18 U.S.C. § 1345(c)); United States v. Krantz, 530 F.
App’x 609, 610 (8th Cir. 2013) (defendant’s three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan not

13

Case 1:14-cr-02783-JB Document 209 Filed 02/23/15 Page 14 of 15

exceptional); United States v. Lea, 360 F.3d 401, 403-04 (2nd Cir. 2004); United States v.
Schmitt, 515 F. App’x 646, 647 (defendant’s cooperation, and his elderly parents’ needs not
exceptional reasons); Varney, 2013 WL 2406256 at 2 (wife’s 24-hour care needs not
exceptional); United States v. Cook, 42 F. App’x 803 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Smith, 34
F.Supp.3d 541, 554 (W.D. Pa. 2014) (in finding that a single mother of two children who works
three jobs did not show exceptional reasons, the court stated: “Most courts agree that ‘purely
personal’ circumstances do not typically rise to the level of exceptional.”); United States v.
Miller, 568 F.Supp.2d 764, 777 (E.D. Ky. 2008) (family hardship does not constitute exceptional
reason); United States v. Green, 250 F.Supp.2d 1145, 1149 (E.D. Mo. 2003) (“personal reasons
alone are not exceptional reasons”); United States v. Lippold, 175 F.Supp.2d 537, 540 (S.D.N.Y.
2001) (“personal family hardships are very common”); United States v. Rodriguez, 50 F.Supp.2d
717, 722 (N.D. Ohio 1999) (“family hardship is not an unordinary consequence of
incarceration”).
The defendant claims that his family circumstances are unusual because his wife, mother
and two children need him. These personal and family reasons are not exceptional. In any
event, Defendant’s two children are adults and his mother has other family members who can
care for her.
As this Court has noted, “exceptional reasons are generally not present in a given case.”
United States v. Ganadonegro, 2012 WL 1132166, *5 (D.N.M.). The five reasons offered by
Defendant in support of his release pending appeal are not exceptional singly or in combination
such that they meet the “strict standard” Congress has set for release under 1345(c). See id.
