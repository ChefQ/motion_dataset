DEFENDANT FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S MOTION TO STRIKE OPINIONS AND

Case 0:14-cv-61344-WPD Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/14/2016 Page 2 of 8

Plaintiff’s belated disclosure of Colin Weir – a new expert witness masquerading as a fact
witness – months after the deadline for expert designations passed and discovery closed, is a
flagrant violation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and this Court’s orders. Under Rule
37(c), failure to timely identify a witness requires, at a minimum, that the witness’s evidence be
excluded, unless the failure is “substantially justified or is harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).
Because Plaintiff’s failure to timely disclose Weir is neither, Ford moves, pursuant to Rule 37(c),
to strike all evidence supplied, analysis performed, and testimony offered by Weir in this case.
I.

BACKGROUND

On November 13, 2015, in accordance with the Court’s most recent scheduling order,
(ECF No. 160), Plaintiff served on Ford the reports of her three experts in this case: Steven
Gaskin, the damages expert, David Renfroe, the engineering expert, and David Penney, the
toxicologist. Discovery closed on January 14, 2016. (ECF No. 160). Subsequently, and also in
accordance with the Court’s scheduling order, Ford filed Daubert motions to exclude each of
these three experts on February 15, 2016. Of relevance to the present discovery dispute was
Ford’s Daubert motion to exclude the testimony of Steven Gaskin. (ECF No. 182). In that
motion, Ford argued, inter alia, that Gaskin’s testimony should be excluded because of his
inability (and admitted lack of qualification) to ascertain the average purchase price of the class
vehicles, a figure which, according to Gaskin, was critical to the ultimate calculation of
classwide damages.
In response to this argument, Plaintiff’s opposition stated – for the first time in this
litigation – that Gaskin’s analysis would in fact comprise only a piece of the damages
calculations. Damages would be ultimately calculated, Plaintiff explained, by multiplying
Gaskin’s diminished value percentage by the total amount of the revenue Ford received from
sales of its 2011-2015 Explorers to authorized dealerships.1 Notwithstanding that the revenue
generated from the sale of class vehicles by Ford to its dealers is a transaction entirely
independent from any sale or lease transaction between dealers and class members, Plaintiff
asserted, without foundation or explanation, that she had “used Ford’s revenue from its dealers as
a proxy for the purchase price [paid by consumers].” (Pl.’s Opp’n to Ford’s Mot. to Exclude

This revenue information was produced by Ford on January 11, 2016 in the form of several
spreadsheets that were designated as covered by the Stipulated Protective Order entered in this
case.

Gaskin, filed under seal Mar. 3, 2016, p. 7). In explaining how she derived a final revenue figure
from the spreadsheets containing revenue data that had been produced by Ford, Plaintiff stated
only that she “sorted all of this information in a way that derived an appropriate sales price for
the sold vehicles and lease price for the leased vehicles. Plaintiff did nothing more than sort the
information provided by Ford.” (Pl.’s Daubert Opp’n, p. 4).
Leaving aside the fact that the revenue “sorting” that Plaintiff conducted could never
generate the figures required for an accurate damages calculation, Plaintiff’s assertion that she
performed this “sort” is false, which Ford discovered when it received Plaintiff’s Rule 26(a)(1)
Second Supplemental Disclosures. These disclosures were served on March 22, 2016, more than
fourth months after Plaintiff’s expert designation deadline, two months after the close of all
discovery, and nearly three weeks after Plaintiff’s Daubert opposition describing her “sorting”
was filed. In these disclosures – and for the first time in this litigation – Plaintiff identified Colin
Weir as a person with information “concerning the merging and organizing of the various Fordproduced spreadsheets used to calculate damages.” (Pl.’s Second Supp. Disclosure, p. 9, Ex. 1 to
Decl. of J. Phillips).
In response to an inquiry from Ford’s counsel about how a third-party non-expert
supposedly had access to Ford’s protected revenue data, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that “Colin
[Weir] has signed the confidentiality agreement and has agreed to be bound by its terms.”
(3/22/16 E-mail from J. Lewis to J. Dewey, Ex. 2). In a follow-up response, Plaintiff’s counsel
reiterated: “[t]hree spreadsheets were sorted . . . and, as I’ve indicated, the person who sorted has
signed the agreement to be bound by the protective order.” (3/23/2016 E-mail from J. Lewis to J.
Conigliaro, Ex. 3). At the March 25, 2016 oral argument on all Ford’s pending Daubert motions,
Plaintiff’s counsel again admitted that Plaintiff herself had not “sorted” Ford’s revenue data,
contrary to her Daubert opposition assertions: “Now, it’s true that Colin Weir performed that
sort. I can’t do that. I don’t know how to do that kind of sort.” (Daubert Hr’g Tr. at 29, Ex. 4).
Plaintiff’s counsel, and Plaintiff herself, do not understand and did not perform the
revenue “sort” because the manipulation and analysis of Ford’s revenue data is the type of
analysis that must be done by an expert. Indeed, the very conclusion that revenue generated from
one transaction can serve as an appropriate “proxy” for the average purchase price of vehicles in
an entirely separate transaction is not a statement of fact but one of opinion that must be founded
on some relevant expertise. As it happens, Colin Weir is an expert who testifies routinely on

damages calculations in class action litigation. See In re ConAgra Foods, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 3d
919, 943-44 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (“Colin Weir is plaintiffs’ economic expert . . . Weir has testified
as an expert in federal and state courts, and before the Federal Communications Commission and
state regulatory commissions . . . Weir opines that: ‘it is possible to determine damages . . . by
applying the scientifically valid economic methodology of hedonic regression to common, classwide, aggregate historical retail price [of] Wesson Oil.”); see also Ebin v. Kangadis Food Inc.,
No. 13-civ-2311 (JSR), 2014 WL 737878, at *1 (S.D.N.Y Feb. 25, 2014) (“The report of
damages expert Colin Weir details several models for calculating damages for this alleged
misrepresentation . . .”).
Further supporting the obvious conclusion that Weir has been retained as an undesignated
expert in this case is the fact that he signed the Stipulated Protective Order and was given access
to Ford’s proprietary information. The terms of the Stipulated Protective Order are clear: the
only possible scenario in which Weir could be a signatory and privy to the protected information
is if he is a retained expert in the case. (See ECF No. 55 at p. 6, § 4(b)(iv)). Thus, Plaintiff’s
acknowledgement that Weir signed the protective order confirms his status as an expert.
II.

ARGUMENT

Rule 37(c) provides that “[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as
required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to
supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially
justified or is harmless.” “Rule 37(c)(1) gives teeth to [Rule 26(a)(2)’s] requirements by
forbidding the use at trial of any information required to be disclosed by Rule 26(a) that is not
properly disclosed.” Yeti by Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp., 259 F. 3d 1101, 1106 (9th
Cir. 2001). Indeed, Rule 37(c) “mandates that a trial court sanction a party for discovery
violations in connection with Rule 26 . . . unless the violation was harmless or substantially
justified.” Young v. Lexington Ins. Co., 269 F.R.D. 692, 693 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (emphasis added)
(internal citations omitted) (granting defendant’s motion to strike where plaintiffs’ expert
disclosures were three months overdue, the discovery deadline was ten days away, and all
Daubert deadlines had passed). The burden here is on Plaintiff to show that her failure to timely
and properly disclose Colin Weir was substantially justified or harmless. See Porto Venezia
Condo. Ass’n, Inc. v. WB Ft. Lauderdale, LLC, No. 11-60665-CIV, 2012 WL 7636003, at *4
(S.D. Fla. Sept. 19, 2012) (Snow, J.)

Case 0:14-cv-61344-WPD Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/14/2016 Page 5 of 8

Pursuant to Rule 37(c), the Court should strike all evidence generated by Colin Weir’s
analyses of Ford’s revenue data. Weir is an untimely and improperly disclosed expert witness
whose work and testimony Plaintiff is attempting to insert into this litigation through a Rule
26(a)(1) supplemental disclosure made after the expiration of all significant deadlines.
First, expert disclosures are made in accordance with Rule 26(a)(2) and not Rule
26(a)(1), the latter of which governs the initial disclosure of potential fact witnesses. Thus,
Plaintiff’s inclusion of Weir – who lacks any personal knowledge of the subject matter of this
case outside of whatever analysis he was asked to do by Plaintiff, based on materials supplied by
Plaintiff – in a Rule 26(a)(1) disclosure is improper under the Rule. More importantly, the
deadline for Plaintiff’s expert disclosures was November 13, 2015, more than four months prior
to Plaintiff’s disclosure of Weir. Therefore, even if Weir had been disclosed as an expert in
accordance with Rule 26(a)(2), which he was not, the disclosure would have been more than four
months late. Indeed, not only has Plaintiff’s expert designation deadline passed, but so has
Ford’s expert deadline, all Daubert motion deadlines, and the scheduled discovery period.
Substantive pretrial motions are due in less than one months’ time. As this Court noted in Young
v. Lexington Ins. Co., “[plaintiffs] have the burden of prosecuting their case and if they had not
already had their experts evaluate damages prior to filing suit to determine a good faith basis for
this action, they should have been developing expert testimony well in advance of the required
disclosure deadlines.” 269 F.R.D. at 694. It is apparent that in the present case, given the passage
of multiple expert-related discovery and motion deadlines, Plaintiff has similarly failed to
exercise diligence in developing her damages theory.
This brazen failure to comply with the requirements of both Rule 26(a) and this Court’s
scheduling order is neither justifiable nor harmless. Ford anticipates that Plaintiff may attempt to
defend the untimeliness of her disclosure of Weir by arguing that she did not receive the revenue
data spreadsheets from Ford until a few days prior to the close of discovery. To this argument
Ford’s response would be twofold. First, Plaintiff received the revenue data spreadsheets from
Ford near the end of discovery because she did not ask for it until less than two months before
the discovery cutoff. Second, and more importantly, Plaintiff did not request this revenue data
from Ford until November 24, 2015 (the day before Thanksgiving) which was eleven days after
her expert disclosure deadline. Thus, to the extent Plaintiff claims that she somehow needed to
evaluate the revenue data before retaining an expert to “sort” it, her failure to request these
-4EAST\123216413.3

Case 0:14-cv-61344-WPD Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/14/2016 Page 6 of 8

documents until after the expiration of her expert deadline precludes any argument that but-for
the supposed delay in Ford’s production, Weir could have been timely disclosed.
Finally, Plaintiff’s delayed and incomplete disclosure of Weir has severely prejudiced
Ford’s defense of this case. Ford sought documents and information pertaining to Plaintiff’s
damages theory in its first Requests for Production of Documents, served on September 19, 2014
and its first set of Interrogatories, served on July 28, 2015. (Ex. 5). Plaintiff’s response to both
discovery requests was that they were premature and covered material that would be the subject
of expert discovery. Id. During the class certification briefing, Plaintiff’s only explanation of her
damages theory was “[t]he framework for this damage analysis is described in the accompanying
Declaration of Steven Gaskin.” (ECF No. 114 at 8). Although Gaskin’s declaration was
submitted in support of her class certification reply brief, Plaintiff refused to designate Gaskin as
an expert under Rule 26 until the Court issued a scheduling order with explicit expert deadlines. 2
When that deadline arrived, Gaskin was the only damages expert disclosed to Ford. Ford has
subsequently built its entire defense to Plaintiff’s damages case on the assurance, through
Plaintiff’s discovery responses and representations to this Court, that Gaskin’s analysis and
opinions constitute the entirety of that case.3 To spring an additional damages expert and a
newly-described damages theory on Ford at this late date would cause extreme prejudice and
should not be permitted.
III.

CONCLUSION

For all the reasons stated above, Ford respectfully requests that the Court strike any and
all evidence generated by Colin Weir, including, but not limited to, the results of any “sorting” of
Ford’s revenue data and any opinions on the suitability of this revenue amount as a “proxy” for
average consumer purchase price.
2

In this scheduling order, the Court faulted Plaintiff for her refusal to produce her expert reports,
finding Plaintiff’s conduct “presumptuous” and that “Plaintiff has now placed the Court in a
position whereby it must again extend all of its pretrial deadlines and reset the trial, or likely
dismiss this action because Plaintiff will have no expert reports upon which to rely.” (ECF No.
160 at 1).

Indeed, Gaskin’s report concluded with the assertion that his methodologies enabled him to
calculate an absolute diminished value per vehicle ($21,000 for exposure to exhaust smell, or
$30,000 for exposure to dangerous levels of exhaust gas), and it gave absolutely no indication
that his analysis would need to be combined with the analysis of another expert in order to
provide a total damages amount.
