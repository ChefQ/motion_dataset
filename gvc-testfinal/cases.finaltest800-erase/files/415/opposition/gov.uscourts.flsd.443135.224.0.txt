Case 0:14-cv-61344-WPD Document 224 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/25/2016 Page 2 of 5

Defendant Ford Motor Company’s latest motion teeters on the following false

premise: It argues that Colin Weir, whom plaintiffs retained as a non-testifying consultant,
is offering expert testimony of the type contemplated by Fed. R. Evid. 702 because (at the

request of plaintiff) he sorted spreadsheet data produced by Ford. This is false. To the extent
that Weir’s testimony is required, it is testimony contemplated by Fed. R. Evid. 1006.

This entire exercise is triggered by two surprising facts about the auto industry:

First, there is no available listing or record of the actual price paid by consumers for new
cars. 1 Second, Ford has no record of the consumers who purchased its new cars. Rather,

Ford records the VIN numbers of the cars it sold to its authorized dealers. 2 It has always

been plaintiff’s intention to apply the diminution in value as a percentage against Ford’s
sale figures to derive total class damages. 3 Here’s what was required.

It starts with the 38,946-line spreadsheet representing the VIN numbers of

Explorers model years 2011-2015 that Ford says it sold to authorized Florida Ford dealers.
That spreadsheet (too large to attach here) was produced on November 6, 2015 for

purpose of distributing class notice. Using outside third-party vendors, plaintiff’s claim

administrator linked 45,827 names and addresses to the produced VIN number list. 4 Next,
in response to a discovery request, Ford produced on January 13, 2016 (the day before
discovery in this case closed) a 34,198-line spreadsheet that, by VIN number, included

various financial information concerning its sale to the dealers of the Explorers, including
the net revenue to Ford for each vehicle sold. (Again, this spreadsheet is too large to

attach). And finally, Ford’s subsidiary, on February 9, 2016 (almost three weeks after

discovery closed) produced a table identifying by year certain identifying information,

including average monthly payment and number of accounts paid off, for Explorers leased

Lewis Decl., Att. A: “So there’s no serial publication of this kind … in terms of the
transaction prices at the retail level nor one that represents the … the range of values that
would be … exhibited at that level.”
2 Att. B: “With regard to your request for information Ford has on class membership, Ford
has records identifying the VINs of 2011-2015 Ford Explorer vehicles originally sold by
Ford to Ford dealers in Florida.”).
3 Court Daubert Order, Docket Entry #215: “[]Plaintiff explains that Gaskin intends to
testify regarding his conjoint analysis results for diminution in value as a percentage of the
value of an Explorer. Plaintiff cites to voluminous pricing evidence provided by Ford …
which it plans to present at trial, so that the jury can apply Gaskin’s conjoint analysis…”)

by Ford Motor Credit in Florida. 5

Plaintiff’s counsel asked Weir to perform certain sorts of the information compiled.

This request was made not because Weir was being asked to present any opinions (he is

not) but because he’s materially more adept with spreadsheets than plaintiff’s counsel. (For
the same reason – his personal technical limitations - plaintiff’s counsel asked a colleague
to place a screenshot into a Daubert opposition brief 6).

First, Weir merged the class notice VIN spreadsheet with the Ford discovery VIN

spreadsheet. More than 6,000 VIN numbers found in the class notice spreadsheet weren’t
reflected in the later-produced spreadsheet, which is presumably explained by Ford’s

counsel in a Feb. 18 email. 7 Weir’s merger of the spreadsheets involved no opinion. Next,

Weir looked up the model type for each of the 34,198 VIN numbers in Ford’s discovery

spreadsheet by a publicly available VIN guide that explains how to “uncode” VIN numbers.
Weir’s application of the guide to the spreadsheet involved no opinion.

In discovery, Ford Motor Credit asserted that “Cab East, LLC is a single purpose

entity whose only business involves holding titles to leased vehicles for Ford Motor Credit

Co.” 8 Accordingly, Weir examined the Ford-produced spreadsheet VIN numbers to identify

those linked to a Cab East, LLC address with the intention of sorting the leased vehicles
from the sold vehicles. Weir next compared Ford Motor Credit’s table with the Ford

discovery spreadsheet VIN numbers. He found that 2,082 leased vehicles identified by Ford
Motor Credit were not associated with Cab East in the Ford-produced spreadsheet. This
comparison does not involve an opinion.

Next, to be conservative, Weir totaled the amount generated to Ford for the sold

vehicles and then reduced that sum by the average revenue generated by the model type of
the “missing” leased vehicles. Weir then totaled what remained. This tally involves no

opinion, and results in a total of $730,932,265.29 in revenue to Ford attributable to Explorers
model years 2011-2015. As to the vehicles segregated as leased, Weir calculated by the total
lease payments, based on the average monthly payment and average term provided by Ford

Motor Credit. Once again, this tally involves no opinion, and results in a total of
$132,341,606.42 attributable to lease payments.
To be sure, the sorting was done meticulously. Weir’s careful approach was

disclosed to Ford through the Daubert briefing 9 along with an invitation to Ford to review

the various spreadsheets Weir generated as part of these sorts (to which Ford didn’t

respond). Plaintiff intends on introducing this information at trial through Fed. R. Evid.

1006, which is tailor-made for this sort of circumstance. Under the rule, plaintiff “may use a
summary, chart or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings … that cannot
be conveniently examined in court.” Courts, in similar settings, have not hesitated in
applying the rule to merged spreadsheets of the type discussed here. 10
The Court should deny Ford’s motion.
