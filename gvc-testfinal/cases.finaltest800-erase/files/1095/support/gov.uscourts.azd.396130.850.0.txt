CR-08-814-001-PHX-DGC

Plaintiff,
MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF
TIME

v.

17 Daniel David Rigmaiden, et al,
18

Defendants.

19
20

The United States, by and through its attorneys undersigned, respectfully requests this

21

Court enter an order enlarging the time for the government to complete its response to defendant

22

Daniel David Rigmaiden’s Motion to Suppress (Docket No. 824) and Motion for Order

23

Requiring Government to Comply With Data Deletion Requirements (Docket No. 847) until

24

Monday, August 20, 2012 (60 days from the date of the Court’s Order permitting defendant to

25

file the Motion to Suppress, Docket No. 844). As the Court is well aware, the prosecution needs

26

additional time to prepare a concise and detailed response to defendant’s unprecedented 369

27

page Motion to Suppress. Obviously, defendant has been working on his Motion to Suppress

28

for many months. Preparing responses to the pending Motions and all of defendant’s relating

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 850 Filed 06/29/12 Page 2 of 2

attachments will require significant effort and time. Accordingly, this request is both reasonable

2

and appropriate.

It is expected that excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) may occur as a result of
this motion or an order based thereon.
Respectfully submitted this 29th day of June, 2012.
