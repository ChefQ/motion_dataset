Defendant.

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Response To Government Motion For Enlargement Of Time (Dkt. #850) To Respond To
18 Various Filings. The government filed a Motion For Enlargement Of Time (Dkt. #850) to
19 respond to the defendant's (1) Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824), and (2) Motion For Order
20 Requiring Government To Comply With Data Deletion Requirements (Dkt. #847) until
21 Monday, August 20, 2012. The defendant has no objection to the government's motion with
22 respect to filing a response to the defendant's Motion To Suppress. However, through this
23 response, the defendant respectfully requests that the Court deny the government's request
24 for a 60 day extension to respond to the defendant's Motion For Order Requiring
25 Government To Comply With Data Deletion Requirements (Dkt. #847).
26

First, the defendant's Motion To Suppress is supported by three separate

27 memorandums raising three entirely separate groups of suppression arguments. The first
28 page of the actual Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824-0) references (1) Memorandum Re:
-1-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 856 Filed 07/06/12 Page 2 of 6

1 Fourth Amendment Violations, (2) Memorandum Re: Destruction Of Evidence, and (3)
2 Memorandum Re: Fourth Amendment Violations (re: N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT).
3 However, the defendant's shadow counsel only attached to Dkt. #824 the defendant's
4 Memorandum Re: Fourth Amendment Violations—which only raised challenges to the
5 government's aircard locating mission. The defendant's shadow counsel then later filed (1)
6 the defendant's Memorandum Re: Fourth Amendment Violations (re: N.D.Cal. 08-704607 HRL/PVT) (Dkt. #830-1)—which only raised challenges to the physical search of apartment
8 No. 1122 and subsequent data storage device searches, and (2) Memorandum Re:

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME (D kt. #850)
TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS FILINGS
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

9 Destruction Of Evidence (Dkt. #830-2)—which only raised challenges to the government's
10 destruction of evidence in the context of suppression. In order to respond to all three of the
11 defendant's memorandums, which all support a request for suppression of evidence at Dkt.
12 #824, the defendant agrees that the government would need at least 60 days. Additionally,
13 on June 29, 2012, the defendant received new evidence from the government regarding IRS14 CI Agent Daun's illegal searches/seizures and the defendant now needs to supplement his
15 Motion To Suppress in light of new facts that change the defendant's arguments. See United
16 States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461-62 (9th Cir. 2000) (continuing a suppression
17 hearing due to the discovery of new evidence of which effected defendant's arguments). Of
18 course, the defendant now also needs to make new discovery requests to the government
19 based on the newly provided June 29, 2012 evidence that was withheld from the defendant
20 since the year 2009.[1]
21

However, with respect to the defendant's Motion For Order Requiring Government To

22 Comply With Data Deletion Requirements (Dkt. #847), the defendant objects to the
23 government being granted 60 days to respond for the following reasons:
24

1.

The defendant's motion at Dkt. #847 is not complex and the issue raised is very

25 straightforward: Will the government comply with the plain terms of the noted warrants or
26 will it not?
27

1.
If the government would handle the discovery process properly—as apposed to
sacrificing
the defendant's rights to save money—such late requests and delays in the case
28
would not be necessary.

2.

If the government raises and wins on a jurisdiction challenge (i.e., the

2 defendant should file the motion in the Northern District of California where the noted
3 warrants were originally issued), there will be at least a 90 day delay before this Court will
4 rule (and possibly agree with the government) and thus at least a 90 day delay before the
5 defendant could possibly have to refile the same motion in the Northern District of
6 California.
7

3.

The defendant is suffering and will suffer further prejudice by the delay

8 considering the government continues to illegally access data and share data with various

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME (D kt. #850)
TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS FILINGS
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

9 government actors of which the government has no authority to access/share. The defendant
10 should not be subjected to at least an additional 90 days of prejudice while it should only
11 take the government at most two weeks to respond to the defendant's motion at Dkt. #847.
12

4.

The defendant's motion at Dkt. #847 is not a suppression motion and any

13 adverse order is immediately appealable due to (1) the ongoing prejudice to the defendant,
14 and (2) the nature of the issue survives the outcome of the defendant's Motion To Suppress
15 and the outcome of the entire case as a whole.[2] Because any adverse order is immediately
16 appealable, the government should respond to Dkt. #847 without further delay.
17

Based on the points and authorities set forth herein, the defendant respectfully

18 requests that the governments Motion For Enlargement Of Time (Dkt. #850) be denied with
19 respect to the defendant's Motion For Order Requiring Government To Comply With Data
20 Deletion Requirements (Dkt. #847). The defendant has no objection to the government's
21 request for additional time to respond to the defendant's Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824)
22 which is supported by and incorporates by reference (1) Memorandum Re: Fourth
23 Amendment Violations (Dkt. #824-2), (2) Memorandum Re: Fourth Amendment Violations
24 (re: N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT) (Dkt. #830-1), and (3) Memorandum Re: Destruction Of
25 Evidence (Dkt. #830-2)—all of which require responses from the government.
26
Even if the Court disagrees with the defendant's assessment that an adverse order with
27 2.
respect to Dkt. #847 is immediately appealable, the defendant will still immediately appeal
28 an adverse order to the Ninth Circuit considering the defendant may lose his chance to
appeal the issue if it later turns out that the order was final as the defendant now believes.

This response was drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant, however, he

2 authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this response on his behalf using the
3 ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has never attended law school. The
4 defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be liberally construed and held to less
5 stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S.
6 519, 520 (1972).
