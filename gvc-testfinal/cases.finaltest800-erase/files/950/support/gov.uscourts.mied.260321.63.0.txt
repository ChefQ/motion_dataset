Plaintiffs,
Vv. Case No. 11-12909
ADIL SHAFI, an Individual,

Defendant.

 

PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO DISMISS CASE WITHOUT PREJUDICE
Plaintiffs, by and their undersigned counsel of record, and pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2), file this motion requesting the Court to enter an Order
dismissing this case without prejudice and without costs to any party. In support of
this motion, Plaintiffs state the following:
1. Defendant's counsel has not filed a Suggestion of Death under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a). See, Model Form 9. However, Defendant Adil Shafi's death
on April 4, 2014 is a matter of public record. See,

hitp://www.obitsforlife.com/obituary/883612/Shafi-Adil.php.

 

2. From time to time, Defendant's present counsel has suggested that Mr.
Shafi would seek to pursue Plaintiffs in connection with the judgment obtained in

case no. 09-10454 against Braintech, Inc., then defunct, with no assets and no
2:11-cv-12909-VAR-LJM Doc#63 Filed 05/01/14 Pg2of7 PgID679

insurance coverage for such judgment. There would be absolutely no merit in
pursuing Plaintiffs in this case relative to the Braintech judgment, but Plaintiffs
would incur defense costs which might, or might not, be recoverable under
Fed.Rule.Civ.P. 11 and/or 28 U.S.C. 1927.

3. Further to the telephonic status conference held on April 17, 2014, the
undersigned counsel discussed this case with Andrew Gerkin, counsel for Barbara
Shafi, the widow of Adil Shafi. Mr. Gerkin indicated that: (a) Ms. Shafi has no
intention of pursing the Braintech judgment, but (b) given the dearth of estate
assets, Ms. Shafi likely would not file a probate court case, without which a
Personal Representative of the Estate of Adil Shafi could not be appointed and,
therefore, there was no one with authority to negotiate the terms of a dismissal of
this case with prejudice.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court enter an order of dismissal
without prejudice in, or substantially in, the form attached as Exhibit A to the
supporting brief filed herewith.

BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS'
MOTION TO DISMISS CASE WITHOUT PREJUDICE
Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2), once contested by the defendant a Plaintiff
may dismiss a case only by Court order "on terms that the Court considers proper."
Whether dismissal should be granted under Rule 41(a)(2) is within the sound
discretion of the district court. Grover by Grover v. Eli Lilly and Co., 33 F.3d 716,
718 (6th Cir. 1994) (citing , Banque de Depots v. Nat'l Bank of Detroit, 491 F.2d
753, 757 (6th Cir. 1974)). More specifically, Rule 41(a)(2) "allows plaintiffs to
freely dismiss their suits, subject to court approval, provided the dismissal does not

prejudice any party." Johnson v. Pharmacia & Upjohn Co., 192 F.R.D. 226, 228

(W.D. Mich. 1999) (quoting Templeton v. Nedlloyd Lines, 901 F.2d 1273, 1274
2:11-cv-12909-VAR-LJM Doc#63 Filed 05/01/14 Pg4of7 PgID681

(5th Cir. 1990)). In fact, generally an abuse of discretion is found only where the
defendant would suffer "plain legal prejudice" as a result of a dismissal without
prejudice, as opposed to facing the mere prospect of a second lawsuit. Grover, 33
F.3d at 718; Kovalic v. DEC Int'l, Inc., 855 F.2d 471, 473 (7th Cir. 1988).

This Court is well acquainted with the facts and procedural posture of this
case. Plaintiffs were in the process of vigorously pursuing their claims in this case
and the Court had appointed a special master to make findings and
recommendations as to whether Defendant had pirated Plaintiffs' software source
code.

Plaintiffs do not wish to pursue their claims against Defendant's estate or
otherwise cause hardship or burden to Ms. Shafi.

However, Plaintiffs do not wish to leave themselves exposed if later the
estate pursues claims against either of them. Understanding that no one presently
acts in a legal capacity for, or is otherwise authorized to act on behalf of, the estate,
Plaintiffs submit that entry of an order of dismissal without prejudice and without
costs to either party would be proper under Rule 41(a)(2) and under these

circumstances.
