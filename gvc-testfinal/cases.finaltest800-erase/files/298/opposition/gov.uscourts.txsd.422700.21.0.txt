PLAINTIFF TIMOTHY POOLE'S RESPONSE TO KIRBY DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:
TIMOTHY JAMES POOLE, Plaintiff, responds to the Motion for Summary Judgment
filed by Defendants, KIRBY INLAND MARINE, LP and KIRBY CORPORATION (“Kirby”),
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Mr. Poole requests that Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment be denied because he is a Jones Act seaman; specifically, 1) he is assigned to
a fleet of commonly owned Kirby barges; 2) he spends more than 75% of his work time on
said barges; and 3) as a Coast Guard licensed tankerman, his work (i.e., loading and
unloading barges) contributes to these barges’ mission of transporting cargo. In support
thereof, he respectfully shows:
I. Introduction and Factual Background
Plaintiff TIMOTHY JAMES POOLE is a seaman and holder of Z-card No. 041120,
which is endorsed for Tankerman-PIC, oil. See Ex. 1 (Poole’s Z-card). He brings this
maritime claim under Rule 9(h), pursuant to the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 688, and general
maritime law. His Original Complaint (Doc. #1) is incorporated by reference.
Defendants, KIRBY INLAND MARINE, LP and KIRBY CORPORATION, owned and
operated the raised trunk barge, KIRBY 11003, on whose defective catwalk Plaintiff was

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 2 of 15

injured. See Ex. 2 (Coast Guard vessel documentation information for KIRBY 11003).
On July 27, 2005, while performing his duties as a tankerman during a cargo
operation aboard one of Kirby’s tank vessels in navigation (KIRBY 11003), Poole was
seriously injured when he slipped, tripped and fell on a catwalk, injuring himself. See Ex.
3 (Deposition of T. Poole) at pp 37, 43, 44, 45-47. His injuries were caused by the
Defendants’ Jones Act negligence and unseaworthiness of the KIRBY 11003.
The following facts are beyond dispute:
1.

Poole is a U.S. Coast Guard licensed tankerman; see Ex. 1.1

2.

Kirby hired Poole as a tankerman2 and he performed tankerman
work for Kirby.3

3.

As a tankerman for Kirby, Poole worked aboard a series of Kirby
barges.4

4.

As a tankerman, Poole performed cargo transfers on barges; in his
own words: “I monitor the tanks with the level flow and keep an eye
on the drafts and stuff and monitor the equipment, the pumps, make
sure we ain’t got no leaks or nothing, same thing with the lines where
we hook the hose up and stuff.” See Ex. 3 at p. 44. Kirby basically
agrees.5

Kirby Inland Marine LP owns the raised trunk barge, KIRBY 11003
on which Plaintiff was injured; it is a documented vessel.6 See Ex.
2.

Kirby seeks summary judgment on grounds that Mr. Poole lacks seaman status and is
ineligible for Jones Act and general maritime law relief, including the right to receive
maintenance and cure.
Kirby’s motion is narrow.

Kirby does not argue that Poole’s career was

predominately shore based or attempt to prove his work percentages; Kirby accepts that
the vast majority of Poole’s work was performed on barges7. Kirby does not deny that the
KIRBY 11003 is a vessel or that it was “in navigation.” Rather, Kirby maintains Poole was
not present aboard the barge when it was moving. It is the mere fact these barges were
docked and not moving when Poole performed his work that propels Kirby’s motion –
although it taxes one’s imagination to visualize how barge cargo could be transferred to a
shoreside terminal, like IPC Deer Park, while a barge was underway.
Kirby makes six legally invalid arguments.8 See Motion at p. 6, “Statement of The
Issues to Be Ruled Upon.” These six points are:

See Ex. 2 (U.S. Coast Guard vessel docum entation inform ation re: KIRBY 11003). Kirby does
not challenge vessel status. See also In Re: Endeavor Marine, Inc., 234 F.3d 287, 288, 291 (5 th Cir.
2000)(not disputed that a derrick barge was a vessel and not disputed that it was ‘in navigation’).
7

Poole’s tim e sheets (Ex. 4) and Barge Book (log) (Ex. 5) confirm that approxim ately 75% of his
work tim e was spent aboard Kirby barges. See also Ex. 7 (Affidavit) authenticating sam e.
See In re Endeavor Marine, Inc., 234 F.3d 287, 291 (5 th Cir. 2000) (reversing a trial court’s
denial of seam an status and rejecting so-called “going to sea” test)(“The [district] court found that
[plaintiff’s] connection to the [barge] was not substantial in nature because ‘it did not take him to sea. His
work brought him aboard the barge only after the vessel was m oored or in the process of m ooring.’ This
application of the ‘going to sea’ test has an intuitive appeal, but we do not believe that the
Supreme Court intended to create such a singular rule for determining seaman status.”)(em phasis

1)

Poole was “never assigned to a boat”9 and hence is supposedly not a
seaman;

2)

Poole never worked aboard a Kirby barge while it was actually underway10
but rather “on non-moving, docked barges” and hence is supposedly not a
seaman;

3)

Poole “did not sleep on a boat”11 and was never assigned a bunk on Kirby
vessels12 and hence is supposedly not a seaman;

4)

Poole was “never part of a crew”13 and hence is supposedly not a seaman;

9

A worker assigned to a fleet of com m only owned vessels is properly a seam an. Roberts v.
Cardinal Services, Inc., 266 F.3d 368, 375 (5 th Cir. 2001) (“Our decisions . . . have reaffirm ed the essential
principle that to qualify as a seam an an em ployee m ust establish an attachm ent to a vessel or to an
identifiable fleet of vessels.”)(em phasis added). Over forty years ago, in Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna
Ferry, Inc., 280 F.2d 523, 528 (5th Cir.1960), the court held that seam an status is not necessarily
dependent on a worker’s assignm ent to one vessel; rather, “there is nothing about this expanding
concept [of seam an status] to lim it it m echanically to a single ship.” An ‘identifiable fleet’ of vessels is
defined as “a finite group of vessels under com m on ownership or control” and in deciding whether there is
an identifiable group of vessels, the question is whether the vessels are subject to com m on ownership or
control. Harbor Tug & Barge Co. v. Papai, 520 U.S. 548, 556-57 (1997), quoting Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis,,
515 U.S. 347, 366 (1995).
10

A vessel need not be underway, or at sea, as a prerequisite to a Jones Act claim and a worker
need not actually navigate or steer the vessel in navigation in order to be considered a seam an. See
McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. W ilander, 498 U.S. 337 (1991); In Re: Endeavor Marine, Inc., 234 F.3d 287, 29091 (5 th Cir. 2000)(a seam an need not “go to sea” as long as his work bears connection to vessel or fleet of
vessels). Seam an status is available as long as the capacity in which he/she was em ployed, or the duties
that he/she perform ed, contributes to the function of the fleet of vessels, or contributes to the
accom plishm ent of the fleet's m ission(s), or to the operation or m aintenance of such an identifiable fleet of
vessels during their m ovem ent, or even while at anchor for the fleet's future trips. Id. This legal principle
is part of the jury instructions for this circuit. See U.S. Fifth Circuit District Judges Ass’n, Pattern Jury
Instructions (Civil Cases) § 4.1 (1992); citing W ilander, 498 U.S. 337.
11

Maritim e law does not require that a Jones Act seam an sleep aboard a vessel. See, e.g.,
Braniff, 280 F.2d 523, 526 (5 th Cir. 1960)(reversing a sum m ary judgm ent dism issing plaintiffs’ seam en
claim s on lack-of-status grounds)(“Of course, Braniff was not assigned to, nor did he stand a watch,
aboard any one of the ferries. He, as well as [co-plaintiff] and other m em bers of the shore gang lived
ashore and their ordinary hours of work were from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00-4:30 p.m. each
day.”)(em phasis added).
12

Maritim e law has never required a worker be assigned a bunk aboard a specific vessel in
order to be considered a seam an. It is doubtful m ost barges have living accom m odations, let alone
bunks. Rather, the Fifth Circuit has found there to be a legitim ate fact issue about seam an’s status in
cases where a worker lives ashore and reports daily for duties on a ferry. See Braniff, 280 F.2d at 526.
13

This argum ent is based on Kirby’s inaccurate assum ption that a worker m ay only be assigned
to one vessel in order to be considered a seam an. Given that Mr. Poole was assigned to a fleet of
com m only owned Kirby barges, it is not surprising he was not part of one vessel’s crew. Being part of a
crew is based on a single-ship assignm ent; a worker assigned to a fleet of com m only owned vessels is
also properly a seam an. Roberts, 266 F.3d at 375.

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

5)

Poole “was under the orders of a unit that was located on shore”14, and
hence is supposedly not a seaman;

6)

Poole allegedly “did not perform the duties of a deck hand”15 and “none of
the work that he performed was ever done on a vessel that was at sea.”16

As shown herein, the evidence conclusively proves Mr. Poole was assigned to a fleet of
commonly owned vessels (i.e., Kirby barges) and that his work aboard them (i.e., as a
tankerman) contributed to their functions. As such, under Supreme Court authority, Poole
is unquestionably a seaman and fully entitled to Jones Act and general maritime law
protection. Kirby’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied.
II. Summary of Argument
Poole is a seaman and, as such, entitled to the protection of the Jones Act and
general maritime law. He is a Coast Guard licensed tankerman and his job supports the
mission of a fleet of commonly owned Kirby barges. His work as a tankerman (i.e., loading
and unloading barges) unquestionably contributes to these vessels’ missions of carrying
and transporting cargo. As such, Poole is a seaman and Kirby’s motion for summary

14

Kirby’s allegation is blatantly false. Poole’s deposition testim ony (Ex. 3) plainly and repeatedly
shows that, when a captain was present, he was under the orders of the captain and subject to the
captain’s control while he was working on and around the barge. See, e.g., Ex. 3 at pp 33-34 (captain
could order him to assist with the lines); p. 56 (captain of the boat could fire him ; captain of boat had
authority over how he perform ed his job).
15

W hether Poole perform ed the duties of a deckhand –as Kirby narrowly and selectively
phrases the issue– is irrelevant. Poole is a licensed tankerman who was hired by Kirby to work as a
tankerman –a distinct position recognized by both Kirby and the USCG regulations. Jones Act seam en
serve in a variety of shipboard positions: they need not all be deckhands and they cannot all be captains.
In any event, Poole’s testimony reflects that, at times, he performed deckhand-type duties, such as
helping to m oor barges. See Ex. 3 (Poole depo.) at p. 33. The captain, if present, could order Poole to
do so. Id.
Moreover, Kirby’s Job Description for Tankerm an (Ex. 6) advises that, “A Tankerm an m ay
be required to throw and catch lines” and “a Tankerm an m ay need to help m ove a crossover hose . . . .“
Poole plainly was expected to, and did, perform deckhand type duties .
16

Kirby’s “going to sea” argum ent is specious. See Endeavor Marine, 234 F.3d 287. The true
legal test is a substantial connection to a vessel, or fleet of vessels, that is in navigation. Id. As shown
herein, the sim ple fact the vessel happens to be in port, or m oored alongside a dock, when the accident
occurs, does not determ ine seam an status. Kirby m isstates the law.

judgment must be denied in all respects. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; In re Endeavor Marine, Inc.,
234 F.3d 287 (5th Cir. 2000); Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 280 F.2d 523, 526
(5th Cir. 1960).
III. Controlling Law
A. Summary Judgment Standards
Kirby seeks summary judgment on the grounds that no genuine issue of material
fact exists and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P.
56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). In responding to summary
judgment, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine
issue for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). Issues of
material fact are genuine ”only if they require resolution by a trier of fact.” Id. at 248. If the
evidence is such that a reasonable fact-finder could find in favor of the nonmoving party,
summary judgment should not be granted. See id.; Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v.
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). Determining credibility, weighing evidence,
and drawing reasonable inferences are left to the trier of fact. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at
255; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
Procedurally, the party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of
informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the
record] which it believes demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.
Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The burden then shifts to the
nonmoving party to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial. See Matsushita, 475
U.S. at 585-87. The Court must accept the evidence of the nonmoving party and draw all
justifiable inferences in favor of that party. Id.

6

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 7 of 15

Because the determination of whether an injured worker is a seaman under the
Jones Act is a mixed question of law and fact, it is usually inappropriate to take the
question from the jury. Harbor Tug, 520 U.S. at 554; In re: Endeavor Marine, Inc., 234
F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir. 2000).
B. Law of Seaman Status
Kirby’s motion challenges seaman status, which is a prerequisite for recovery under
the Jones Act and the general maritime law. The status test for seaman is the same for
both theories. See T.J. Schoenbaum, ADMIRALTY & MARITIME LAW (2d ed. 1994), § 4-1.
With respect to the Jones Act and general maritime law, the U.S. Supreme Court
in the 1990s identified two basic elements of seaman status: (1) the worker's duties must
contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, and (2) the
worker must have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or an identifiable fleet of vessels)
that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature. Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515
U.S. 347, 376 (1995). To be a seaman, the plaintiff, in the course of his duties, must have
contributed to the function of a vessel. See Waguespack v. Aetna Life & Casualty Co., 795
F.2d 523, 525 (5th Cir.1986); Chandris, 515 U.S. at 376. This, of course, is a different
proposition than Kirby’s false assertion that a plaintiff must have helped to navigate the
vessel, or go to sea on a vessel.
The “going to sea” notion suggested by Kirby’s motion is not the law. See In re:
Endeavor Marine, Inc., 234 F.3d 287 (5th Cir. 2000)(“For these reasons, the district court
incorrectly concluded that Baye is not a Jones Act seaman merely because his duties do
not literally carry him to sea. “). Instead of the “going to sea” notion, a plaintiff must show
a “connection to a vessel in navigation that is substantial in terms of both duration and
nature.” Chandris, 515 U.S. at 376; Endeavor, 234 F3d. at 291-292.
7

What is important

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 8 of 15

and controlling is the worker’s assignment to a vessel, or commonly owned fleet of vessels.
Id.
When a person’s work takes him into both the shipboard and shoreside arenas,
he/she must show that he has a ‘substantial connection’ to a vessel –this is legally
determined to be approximately 30% of his overall work time. See Chandris, 515 U.S. at
371; Barrett v. Chevron USA, Inc., 781 F.2d 1067, 1076 (5th Cir.1986). As noted above,
Kirby’s motion does not assert that Poole somehow spent less than 30% of his Kirby
career on barges. And in any event, such an assertion would be blatantly false: Poole
spent approximately 75% of his “Kirby time” working aboard various Kirby barges. See Ex.
4 (Poole’s time sheets) and Ex. 5 (Poole’s Barge book or log), and Ex. 7 (Affidavit of Mr.
Poole). There is no evidence suggesting Poole worked ashore for a significant portion of
his time.
Kirby’s motion (at p. 9) invokes the standard for seaman status under the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. § 207 (FLSA), which is more restrictive than that used
with the Jones Act and general maritime law. See Owens v. SeaRiver Maritime, Inc., 272
F.3d 698 (5th Cir. 2001) and authorities discussed therein.17 Given this dissimilarity, courts
have found that a barge tender is a seaman for FLSA purposes and thus comes within
exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime provision, but an industrial
worker on a dredge barge is not. See Owens, 272 F.3d at 704. Kirby’s citation of Owens
(Motion at p. 9) is misleading and improper: the issue here is not whether Poole qualifies
as a seaman under the FLSA –but rather, the Jones Act. Actually, the Owens decision fully

17

Sim ilarly, other circuits have concluded that the FLSA definition of seam an is narrower than
the Jones Act definition. Pacific Merchant Shipping Ass’n. v. Aubry, 918 F.2d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir.1990);
Sternberg Dredging Co. v. W alling, 158 F.2d 678, 680-81 (8th Cir.1946).

8

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 9 of 15

supports Poole because it shows that, under the Jones Act, he is indeed a seaman.
Owens, 272 F.3d at 70_, fn. 7 : “We do not suggest that Owens, while a member of the
Strike Team, was not a seaman for Jones Act purposes.” Owens thus mandates that
Kirby’s motion be denied because it confirms that Poole is a Jones Act seaman by virtue
of his work.
IV. Argument & Authorities
Kirby’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied because the evidence
attached hereto conclusively establishes that Poole is a seaman covered by the Jones Act,
46 U.S.C. § 688, and general maritime law. Specifically, Poole meets the Chandris test
because he was assigned to a fleet of commonly owned vessels in navigation (i.e., Kirby
barges) and his work aboard them (i.e., as a Coast Guard licensed tankerman) was
substantial both in its terms of duration and nature. As such, Poole is unquestionably a
seaman. Kirby’s motion fails to establish that Mr. Poole does not meet the Chandris test.
Instead, Kirby raises a series of specious arguments which are addressed below.
Kirby’s arguments as to why Poole is not a seaman are readily refuted:
A.

Kirby’s attempt to distinguish a “shore tankerman” from a “boat
tankerman” is specious.

Kirby’s Motion repeatedly avers that it designated Mr. Poole as a “shore tankerman”
rather than what it calls a “boat tankerman.” See, e.g., Motion at p. 4 (“Mr. Poole was a
shore tankerman; he was not a boat tankerman.”); see also Guidry and Kittley affidavits
attached to Motion. Kirby admits that its so-called “boat tankermen” are seamen (id. at pp.
4-5), but hopes that its concocted label of “shore tankerman” will prevent this Court from
treating Poole as a seaman. The customary protection afforded seamen by admiralty
courts, however, is not easily eschewed.
9

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 10 of 15

First, Kirby itself may not recognize the nomenclature urged by its Motion and by the
affiants Guidry and Kittley. See Ex. 6, Kirby’s “Tankerman Job Description.” This
company document does not differentiate between “boat” and “shore” tankermen but
instead reflects that all tankermen, “must possess a valid and current merchant mariners’
document with a Tankerman’s endorsement . . . ” Second, the Coast Guard regulatory
scheme of certification for merchant mariners18 does not recognize the semantic distinction
made by Kirby’s motion. Rather, the regulations reflect that tankermen must be competent
in the transfer of oils and hazardous fluids aboard tank vessels. This reality is reflected in
Kirby’s Tankerman Job Description (Ex. 6), which requires that a tankerman be licensed
under 46 CFR Part 12 (entitled "Certification of Seamen"). The regulations themselves
require tankermen to comply with Coast Guard regulations. 46 CFR 16.105. There is no
exception for so-called shore tankermen. The federal regulations fail to make the alleged
distinction so readily drawn by Kirby in the affidavits of Messrs. Guidry and Kittley.
Moreover, federal courts find that tankermen who work on barges in similar
capacities to Mr. Poole are, in fact, seamen entitled to Jones Act protection. See, e.g.,
Wuestewald v. Foss Maritime Co., 319 F.Supp.2d 1002 (N.D. Cal. 2004)(a tankerman
brought action against the owner of a bunker barge and dock owner under general
maritime law and Jones Act to recover for injuries sustained when he fell from a ladder
while attempting to access a dock from a barge; the court found, inter alia, that the barge
owner was negligent by failing to provide the tankerman with a safe means of access to

18

See 46 CFR 13.103 (definitions)(Tankerman-Assistant m eans a person holding a valid
``Tankerm an- Assistant'' endorsem ent to his or her Merchant Mariners’ Docum ent (MMD). TankermanEngineer m eans a person holding a valid ``Tankerm an- Engineer'' endorsem ent to his or her MMD.
Tankerman-PIC m eans a person holding a valid ``Tankerm an-PIC'' endorsem ent to his or her MMD.
Tankerm an-PIC (Barge) m eans a person holding a valid ``Tankerm an-PIC (Barge)'' endorsem ent to his or
her MMD.

10

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

and from the dock). In short, Poole is a tankerman, and regardless of Kirby’s attempt to
pigeonhole him as a shore tankerman, a tankerman’s duties are strictly proscribed by the
U.S. Coast Guard, which is responsible for their regulation and license. Kirby’s attempt to
label Mr. Poole out of seaman status and protection fails.
B.

Kirby’s notion that the fact Poole was injured on a docked barge, and
that most of his Kirby career involved work on docked or moored
barges, means that he cannot be a seaman, is specious

Kirby’s motion also argues that Mr. Poole is a land-based worker who happened to
be injured aboard a non-moving barge. According to Kirby, this disqualifies him from being
considered a seaman. Significantly, however, Kirby does not argue that its barge was
somehow incapable of navigation; rather, it says that it was not moving at the time Mr.
Poole was doing his work. Temporal mobility is irrelevant in Jones Act analysis. A leading
horn-book on maritime law states:
[The concept of a vessel in navigation] is liberally applied and a vessel is
considered ‘in navigation’ although it is in port, or under repair. Furthermore,
a vessel may be in navigation although it is stationary, moored or fixed in
place.
T.J. Schoenbaum, ADMIRALTY & MARITIME LAW , at 4-9, pg. 215 (2d ed. 1994). The Kirby
11003 was “in navigation” because it was capable of being used for transport. In fact, it
appears to have arrived at ITC, Deer Park, just before the time that Poole did. See Ex. 3
at p. 35.
There is no requirement that a vessel actually be underway when an accident
occurs, or even that the accident must occur aboard the ship. See, e.g., Thier v. Lykes
Bros. Inc., 900 F.Supp. 864 (S.D. Tex. 1995). In Thier, a merchant marine cadet was
seriously injured in an automobile accident that occurred ashore in Lake Charles, while his
ship was moored in the port. He was riding to dinner in a rental truck that was being driven

11

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 21

Filed in TXSD on 06/22/06 Page 12 of 15

by the vessel’s chief officer, who flipped the vehicle, killing himself and injuring the plaintiff.
The cadet was found to be a Jones Act seaman and successfully recovered against the
vessel owner.
Finally, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has specifically rejected any notion that a
Jones Act seaman’s work must literally “carry him to sea.” As long as the worker is
performing work in service to a vessel, he is a Jones Act seaman. In Re: Endeavor
Marine, Inc., 234 F.3d 287 (5th Cir. 2000), citing Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. at 368.
In Endeavor Marine, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a District Court’s denial of
seaman status, rejecting its use of a so-called “going to sea” test: “The [district] court
found that [plaintiff’s] connection to the [barge] was not substantial in nature because ‘it did
not take him to sea. His work brought him aboard the barge only after the vessel was
moored or in the process of mooring.’ This application of the ‘going to sea’ test has an
intuitive appeal, but we do not believe that the Supreme Court intended to create
such a singular rule for determining seaman status.” 234 F.3d at 291 (emphasis
added). Quoting Chandris, the Fifth Circuit stated, “Thus, even a ship repairman (which
is traditional longshoreman work and is one of the enumerated occupations under the
LHWCA) may qualify for seaman status if he has the requisite employment-related
connection to the vessel.” Id.
C.

Poole’s work aboard the Kirby barge – i.e., loading and unloading
petroleum products– contributes to the mission and function of the
barge. Indeed, that is the function and mission of the barge.

Poole’s deposition testimony (Ex. 3, at p. 44) makes clear that he was working to
monitor the loading and unloading of cargo on the barges. To use Poole’s own words: “I

the equipment, the pumps, make sure we ain’t got no leaks or nothing, same thing with the
lines where we hook the hose up and stuff.” Ex. 3 at p. 44. Poole also testified that he
was in control of the transfer. Id. at p. 34. Even Kirby concedes that Poole’s main job “was
to load and unload barges.” See Motion at p. 9, ln. 9. The role of a cargo barge is
obviously to carry cargo, and a tankerman who loads and unloads cargo is essential to this
process.
D.

Kirby’s notion that the fact Poole did not sleep on a Kirby boat, and was
not assigned a berth on a Kirby boat, somehow bars him from being a
seaman is specious.

Kirby directs the Court to no legal authority that recognizes a berth as a prerequisite
to seaman status. While some seamen sleep on vessels, this is not an essential
requirement to seaman status. Such sweeping authority would be odd, given that many
vessels involved in successful Jones Act claims –e.g., barges and ferry boats– lack living
accommodations.
Similarly, Kirby’s other factual observations (see pp. 13-15 of its motion) are simply
recitations of factors that might have been helpful in other cases though Kirby has failed
to cite them. However, these facts are not requisite to seaman status. As stated above,
Mr. Poole is a seaman because (1) he is assigned to a fleet of commonly owned Kirby
barges; (2) he spends more than 75% of his work time on said barges; and (3) he performs
seaman’s work because he is a Coast Guard licensed tankerman and his work as a
tankerman (i.e., loading and unloading barges) contributes to these vessels’ mission of
carrying cargo. This is the legal test. In contrast, the facts cited by Kirby do not address
these standards– e.g., signing a visitor’s book upon boarding a tugboat; not being
introduced to the members of a barge’s crew (however, it appears Poole was the only
tankerman aboard the barge); not being explained the general operation of the boat or the

schedule aboard the boat (though this would seem to suggest that Poole was an
experienced professional who didn’t need such explanation; he was in control of the
operation, see Ex. 3 at p. 34); etc.
What is significant is that the evidence conclusively proves Mr. Poole was assigned
to a fleet of commonly owned vessels (i.e., Kirby barges) and that his work aboard them
(i.e., as a tankerman) contributed to their function. As such, Poole is unquestionably a
seaman –regardless of whether he ever actually, say, prepared steel for paint or chipping,
or whether he ever put out jockey/ breast/ face/ backing/ towing wires– who is fully entitled
to Jones Act and general maritime law protection.
V. Conclusion and Prayer for Relief
Poole is a Jones Act seaman entitled to the protections of the general maritime law.
He was assigned to a fleet of commonly owned Kirby barges, and had a connection to
them that was substantial in terms of duration and function. Kirby has not proven any
entitlement to summary judgment under Rule 56. In fact, there is sufficient (indeed
conclusive) evidence to support Plaintiff’s claim that he is a seaman due to the fact that
he performed his work on a fleet of commonly owned Kirby tank barges and his work as
a U.S. Coast Guard-licensed tankerman contributed to the fleet’s (and the barge’s)
mission. As such, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment to deny seaman status
must be denied, and Plaintiff’s suit allowed to proceed.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiff, TIMOTHY JAMES POOLE,
prays that the Kirby Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment be denied in all respects.
Plaintiff prays for all such other and further relief, at law and in equity, to which he may be
justly entitled.
