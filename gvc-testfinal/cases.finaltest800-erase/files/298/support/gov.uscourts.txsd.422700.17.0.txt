DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

COME NOW, Defendants Kirby Corporation and Kirby Inland Marine, LP (hereinafter
"Kirby" unless otherwise specified) and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, file this motion for
summary judgment and brief in support of their `motion for summary judgment on the grounds
that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that these defendants are entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. More specifically defendants request dismissal of plaintiff's claims pursuant
to the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. Appendix 0x00A7 688, as well as dismissal for his claims for
unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure pursuant to general maritime law. In support of their
motion, these defendants rely upon all of the pleadings and discovery on file with this Court, this
defendants' brief in support of their motion for summary judgment, the affidavit of Kallum K.
Kittley, the affidavit of James C. Guidry, partial portions of the deposition of Timothy Poole and
such other discovery, pleadings, or affidavits as may hereafter be filed in accordance with the
law.

I.
NATURE AND PROCEDURAL STAGE OF THE ACTION

The plaintiff, Mr. Poole, filed suit on or about November 30, 2005 naming the

defendants, from which he seeks damages for various claims including allegations that he was a
 

 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 2 of 17

seaman under the Jones Act and therefore is entitled to maintenance and cure relating to his fall
on July 27, 2005. (Plaintiff's complaint attached as Exhibit "A"). The alleged fall occurred
while Mr. Poole was employed by Kirby Logistics Management as a shore tankerman. It is
alleged that he lost his footing on a catwalk on a docked barge thereby injuring his wrist. (Poole
Depo. attached as Exhibit "D" at pgs. 45-49; Ins. 6-11). The defendants filed their answers, and
within the answers denied plaintiffs status as a Jones Act seaman. (Defendants' Answers
attached as Exhibits "B" and "C"). Defendants bring this instant motion for summary judgment
on the basis that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Mr. Poole's status. Mr.
Poole's Jones Act claims as well as his claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure
should be dismissed as he is not a Jones Act seaman, but rather a longshoreman.

Timothy Poole commenced work with Kirby in October of 2004. (Poole Depo. at pg. 10;
Ins.22-24). When he applied for the job, he told Kirby that he did not want to go out on boats,
but stay close to his family. (Poole at pg. 11; Ins 15-22). He was told when he applied at Kirby
that he could be placed in the shoreside division, and was in fact placed in the shoreside division
of Kirby Logistics Management. (Poole at pg. 12; Ins 5-11). Boat tankerman are within the
Kirby Inland Marine division. (See Guidry Affidavit attached as Exhibit "E"). Mr. Poole was
hired by Kirby Logistics which is the shoreside tankerman division which Mr. Poole described as
the division which hires tankerman who go from dock to dock working on barges. (Poole at pg.
13; Ins. 3-9). Once completing training, Mr. Poole was designated as a tankerman trainee.
(Poole at pg. 13; Ins. 21-23). After taking a tankerman class for Coast Guard certification, Mr.
Poole became a tankerman. (Poole at pg. 14; Ins.1-9).

As a shoreside tankerman, Mr. Poole was never assigned to a boat. (Poole at pg. 11; Ins.

23-25). Mr. Poole only worked on Kirby barges which were not always pushed by boats owned
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 3 of 17

by Kirby. (Poole at pg. 57; Ins. 11-21). Mr. Poole never worked on a barge while it was
underway (Poole at pg. 60, Ins. 22-24). He was never a crew member of a boat. (Poole at pg.
12; Ins. 3-4). If Mr. Poole ever went on a tug boat while working, he was required to sign in on
the visitor book and to show identification upon boarding. (Poole at pgs. 25-26; Ins. 2-5). When
he went out on a job, he was not introduced to the members of the boat's crew. (Poole at pg. 61;
Ins. 8-10). He was not given a tour of the boat or assigned a bunk. (Poole at pg. 61; Ins. 11-14).
When arriving at a job, nobody explained to Mr. Poole the general operation of the boat, nor did
anyone explain to him what his work schedule would be, what to do in a man overboard drill, a
collision drill or an abandon ship drill. (Poole at pgs. 61-62; Ins. 15-3).

Mr. Poole worked shift work, meaning that he was on call for seven days and then off for
two days. (Poole at pg. 27; Ins.2-8). He was paid hourly and earned overtime pay for working
over forty hours in a week. (Poole at pgs. 16-12). If called or paged during his seven days on
call, Mr. Poole could pass on a job during this time. (Poole at pg. 28; Ins. 13-14). When going
to a dock, Mr. Poole would drive his own truck and would get reimbursed for his mileage to the
dock. (Poole at pg. 31; Ins. 16-23). When he went to a job, Mr. Poole would bring his own
equipment along with his own lunch and water or whatever he chose to drink. (Poole at pgs. 31-
32; Ins. 24-15).

While performing the transfer of liquid materials to or from the barge, Mr. Poole as the
tankerman would be in control of the transfer, not the Captain of the tug boat. (Poole at pg. 34;
Ins.17-24). The Captain of the tug boat could not order Mr. Poole as the tankerman to clean the
boat, cook food for the crew or do any other such tasks on board the tug. (Poole at pg. 34; Ins. 1-

16). Mr. Poole did not sleep on board the tug boats. (Poole at pg. 12; Ins. 1-2). Mr. Poole never
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 4 of 17

received an assignment from a boat or anybody on a boat while working for Kirby. (Poole at pg.
57; Ins. 1-3).

While at Kirby, Mr. Poole reported to four different individuals, none of whom were
members of a crew or of a boat. (Poole at pgs. 55-56; Ins. 15-1). All of Mr. Poole's reporting as
to how the job was progressing and any problems were reported to the dispatch unit located
downtown. (Poole at pg. 57; Ins. 4-7).

During his entire time with Kirby, Mr. Poole never worked on a barge while it was
underway. (Poole at pg. 60; Ins. 22-24). He likewise never worked on a boat while it was
underway. (Poole at pgs. 60-61; Ins. 25-2).

Mr. Poole was a shore tankerman; he was not a boat tankerman. Had Mr. Poole been a
boat tankerman, his job duties and work would differ from those that he had as a shore
tankerman. Unlike Mr. Poole, a boat tankerman works hitches whereby he is on a boat for 14-21
days at atime. (See Guidry Affidavit). The boat tankerman stands watch and is assigned a work
schedule with shifts. (See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen are paid on a daily basis, not
hourly. (See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen are part of the crew of the tug boat on which
they travel. (See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen are assigned to a boat, and most often sleep
and eat on the boat. (See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen do not use or bring their own tools.
(See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen do not need to sign the guest book when boarding
because they are a part of the crew. (See Guidry Affidavit). Boat tankermen are supervised by
the boat's captain, and are instructed to do their job by the captain. (See Guidry Affidavit). The
duties which a boat tankerman can be instructed to do onboard a boat include deckhand duties

such as performing engine room maintenance, preparing the steel for paint or chipping, scaling

or buffing the boats. (See Guidry Affidavit). A boat tankerman's duties while on board a boat
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 5 of 17

may also include preparing meals for the crew. (See Guidry Affidavit). Mr. Poole never
performed engine room maintenance, never prepared steel for paint, and never painted while
working for Kirby. (Poole at pg. 60; Ins. 11-21).

A boat tankerman could also perform a host of other activities that such as putting out
rest wires, jockey wires, face wires, wing wires, backing wires, towing wires and building a
strung-out coupling, a breasted-up coupling or a high-low coupling. (See Guidry Affidavit). Job
duties of a boat tankerman could also include breaking coupling or building steering coupling.
(See Guidry Affidavit). Mr. Poole never performed any of these activities. (Poole Depo. at pgs.
58-60; Ins. 23-7).

If Mr. Poole had been a boat tankerman and had traveled on the tug as do boat
tankerman, he would have been assigned a bunk and have explained to him the general operation
of the boat. (See Guidry Affidavit). He would have also been educated on what to do in a man
overboard drill, a collision drill and an abandon ship drill. (See Guidry Affidavit).

In sum, a boat tankerman is part of a crew of an assigned boat while a shore tankerman is
not assigned to any boat and is not part of any crew. (See Kittley Affidavit attached as Exhibit
"F"; (See Guidry Affidavit). A shore tankerman is paid an hourly wage and is paid overtime.
(See Kittley Affidavit). Shore tankermen do not work specific shifts, but are typically on call
for seven days at a time and then off call for two. (See Kittley Affidavit). Once called to a job, a
shore tankerman does not travel on the tug boats as do boat tankerman, but drives himself from
one dock to another and is reimbursed for his mileage. (See Kittley Affidavit). Shore tankerman
are not directed in their work by the captain of the boat, but are told where to go by dispatch
which is located on-shore. (See Kittley Affidavit). If any trouble or incident should arise while

at the worksite, the shore tankerman would report back to a land-based supervisor, and not the

 
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 6 of 17

boat's captain. (See Kittley Affidavit). Shore tankermen do not work on barges that are
underway, but only those that are docked. (See Kittley Affidavit). In sum, a shore tankerman

will not spend any time on a vessel at sea.

II.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES TO BE RULED UPON BY THE COURT
AND STANDARD OF REVIEW

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE: Whether Mr. Poole can be classified as a seaman and
fall within the Jones Act where all of his work as a shore tankerman was performed on shore or
on non-moving, docked barges; where he was never assigned to a boat; where he did not sleep on
a boat; where he was never part of a crew; where he was under the orders of a unit that was
located on shore; where he did not perform the duties of a deck hand and where none of the work
that he performed was ever done on a vessel that was at sea.

STANDARD OF REVIEW: A party is entitled to summary judgment if it can
demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material facts and that it is entitled to summary
judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Co. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986).
If the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, the movant may meet its burden by
showing the absence of any evidence to support the non-movant's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at
325. The defendant, as movant, is entitled to summary judgment if the evidence disproves as a
matter of law at least one element of each of the plaintiff's causes of action. Lear Siegler, Inc. v.
Perez, 819 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex. 1991). Once the moving party has made the required
showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to come forward with evidence to show that
summary judgment should not be granted. George v. Bourgeois, 825 F.Supp. 1341, 1346 (E.D.
Tex. 1994). The non-moving party must show, with factual specificity, evidence demonstrating

the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on every element of its case. Id. (citing Dunn v.

 
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 7 of 17

State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 927 F.2d 869, 872 on Cir. 1991)). The court must view the
evidence in a light most favorable to the non-movant. Id. (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co.
Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Co., 475 U.S. 574 586 (1986)).

While the seaman inquiry is a mixed question of both law and fact, summary judgment is
mandated where the facts and law will reasonably support only one conclusion. Harbor Tug and
Barge Co. v. Papai, 520 U.S. 548, 554 (1997) (citing McDermott International, Inc. v. Wilander,
498 U.S. 337, 356 (1991), Chandris, Inc. y Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 368-369 (1995)). Seaman
status is an element of the plaintiff's case for which he bears the burden for establishment of the
seaman status. Nicole v. Southstar Industrial Contractors, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 7544 at pg. 2
(E.D. of La. 2004).

Hil.
ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY

 

One of the most recent United States Supreme Court cases to define the test for whether a
maritime worker qualifies as a seaman under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688(a) versus being
classified as a longshoreman is Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347 (1995). The Chandris
Court commenced its analysis by pointing out that it is well-settled law that the Jones Act is
fundamentally status based and the question of seaman status cannot be resolved by simply
looking that the situs of the alleged injury: "land-based maritime workers do not become seamen
because they happen to be working on board a vessel when they are injured, and seamen do not
lose Jones Act protection when the course of their service to a vessel takes them ashore." Jd. at
361. The Court also pointed out the difficulties courts have had in determining the status of
seamen versus longshoremen. The Chandris Court looked closely at the cases in the Fifth
Circuit and concluded that the employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation that is

necessary for a maritime worker to qualify as a "seaman" under the Jones Act requires two basic

 
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 8 of 17

elements, namely that (a) the worker's duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to
the accomplishment of its mission, and (b) that the worker must have a connection to the vessel
in navigation or an identifiable group of vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration
and its nature. Jd at 368. Regarding the first element, the Jones Act only extends to those

`employees who do the ship's work while at sea. Id. at 368 (citing Wilander, supra at 354). The
Jones Act remedy is specifically reserved for those sea-based maritime employees whose work
"regularly exposes them to `the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to
sea in ships are subjected.'" Jd. at 370 (citing Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 104
(1946))(see also Harbor Tug and Barge Co. v. Papai, ,520 U.S. 548, 560 (1997) indicating that
the Jones Act is confined to seamen whose work regularly exposes them to the "perils of the
sea"')).

The Chandris court acknowledged that it is difficult to discern major substantive
differences in the language of the two phrases, but that one is to look at the totality of the
circumstances in the employment. /d at 370. The duration of the worker's connection to a
vessel and the nature of the activities, taken together determine whether a maritime worker is a
seaman "because the ultimate inquiry is whether the worker in question is a member of the
vessel's crew or simply a land-based employee who happens to be working on the vessel at a
given time." Jd. at 370.

For maritime workers, the question then is whether the plaintiff can maintain Jones Act
and related maritime claims which are dependent upon his seaman status, or whether he is
relegated to claims under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 0x00A7
902 ("SLHWCA"). Schultz v. Louisiana Dock Co., 94 F. Supp.2d 746, 748 (E.D. of La 2000).

Under the LHWCA, the exclusivity provision states in part that the liability of the employer

 
 

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 _ Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 9 of 17

"shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee. . ." Jd.
citing 33 U.S.C. 0x00A7 902(3). The term "employee" as defined by the LHWCA, does not include "a
master or member of a crew of any vessel." Jd. citing 33 U.S.C. 0x00A7 902(3). The phrase "master or
member of a crew of any vessel is a `refinement' of the term `seaman' in the Jones Act. Id.
citing McDermott International v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337, 349 (1991). Although the Fifth
Circuit has not truly defined a "seaman", the Fifth Circuit did discuss such in a case examining
whether individuals were classified as seaman for purposes of FLSA. Owens vy. Seariver
Maritime Inc., 272 F.3d 698 (5" Cir. 2001). That Court held that the plaintiff's job as a
tankerman whose main job it was to load and unload barges (exactly what Mr. Poole did) was
not seaman's work, at least under the definition of the FLSA. Owens, supra at 704. The Court
further explained that the loading and unloading of petroleum products from a vessel does not
aid in the navigation or operation of the vessel, but only prepares a vessel for navigation, and that
therefore he did not fall within the definition therefore as a "seaman." Jd.

The fundamental purpose of this second requirement is to separate the sea-based
maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act protection from land-based workers who have
only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation, and whose employment does
not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea. Id. at 368. The Chandris Court discussed the
Fifth Circuit's general rule that a worker who spends less than about 30 percent of his time in the
service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act and stated
that this should serve as "no more than a guideline. . .and departure from it will certainly be
justified in appropriate cases." Jd. at 371. The United States Supreme Court in Harbor Tug and

Barge Co. v. Papai further clarified the rule as set forth in Chandris by stating in part:

 
 

'

Case 3:05-cv-00651 Document 17-9 Filed in TXSD on 05/26/06 Page 10 of 17

"For the substantial connection requirement to serve its purpose, the inquiry into the

nature of the employee's connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the

employee's duties take him to sea. This will give substance to the inquiry in both the
duration and nature of the employee's connection to the vessel and be helpful in

distinguishing land-based from sea-based employees." Harbor Tug and Barge Co. v.

Papai, 520 U.S. 548, 555 (1997).

In fact, since the Chandris case, courts have granted summary judgment against workers
who claim Jones Act seaman status irregardless of the fact that the worker may have spent more
than 30 percent of his work time aboard vessels. Saienni v. Capital Marine Supply, Inc., 2005
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6928 at 29 (E. Dist. Of LA 2005) (citing Bouvier v. Krenz, 702 F.2d 89, 92 (5
Cir. 1988); Schultz v. Louisiana Dock Co., 94 F, Supp.2d 746, 750 (E.D. La. 2000); Richard v.
Mike Hooks, Inc., 799 8.2d 462, 467 (La. 2001).

In Bouvier, the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court's granting of summary judgment
where the riggers were shore-based workers who worked a shift and then went home; never ate
or slept aboard a vessel and never went to see. Bouvier at 90-91. The Court held that even
though they spent more than 50 percent of their time working on ships that summary judgment
was still proper given the totality of circumstances. Id.

In Schultz, the Court granted summary judgment even though the plaintiff averred that he
spent time more than 40 percent of his time working on floating, moored barges and 40 percent
of his time being transported on tugboats to reach barges. Schultz, at 750. The Court held that
regardless of the amount of time he spent working on barges (one percent or 100 percent) that
the totality of circumstances demonstrated that he was not a seaman as a matter of law. Id The
plaintiff in Schultz was a worker who was employed to repair barges, but much like Mr. Poole,
the Court looked at the fact that the worker slept at home, drove to the facility each day, did not

eat or sleep on any of the barges, never traveled or participated in any voyages with any of the

barges being repaired and never acted as a deckhand on any vessel. Jd. at 747.
