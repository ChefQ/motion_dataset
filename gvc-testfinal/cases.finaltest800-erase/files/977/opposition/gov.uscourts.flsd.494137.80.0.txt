CASE NO. 16-cv-24267
JUAN L. PEREZ and
MARIA A. POSADA, his wife,
Plaintiffs,
v.
THE CITY OF SWEETWATER,
RAFAEL DUARTE, RICHARD BRIOSO
and ARMANDO GONZALEZ
Defendants.
____________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT CITY OF SWEETWATER’S MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiffs Juan Perez and Maria Posada, through their undersigned counsels hereby submits
this brief in opposition of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and respectfully move
this Honorable Court to deny the motion. In support thereof, Plaintiffs have filed a concurrent
Statement of Material Facts and references their contents.
Standard of Review
In a Motion for Final Summary Judgment, the moving party carries a heavy burden.
Summary Judgment is only appropriate when the movant has shown conclusively that no
genuine issues of material fact remain; every inference is drawn in favor of the party against
whom summary judgment is sought. Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1247
(11th Cir. 2013). “Particular caution should be employed when granting summary judgment in
negligence actions.” Lindsey v. Bill Arfin Bonding Agency, 645 So. 2d 565 (Fla. 1st DCA
1994). “The record must be read in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Charlonne

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 2 of 14

v. Rosenthal. 642 So. 2d at 634. “If the record reflects the existence of genuine issues of fact or
the possibility of any issue, or if the record raises even the slightest doubt that an issue might
exist, that doubt must be resolved against the party moving for summary judgment,” Quest Air
South, Inc. v. Memphis Group, Inc., 733 So. 2d 1109 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999). The inquiry is
"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or
whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail by a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-252 (1986). All of the evidence and inferences drawn from that
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for
summary judgment. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587
(1986).

Argument
I.

There was clearly a substantive Due Process Violation

There was a violation of Juan Perez’s constitutional rights pursuant to the Fourteenth
Amendment substantive due process clause. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118
S.Ct. 1708, 1717 (1998). The Plaintiff has shown that when the evidence is viewed in a light
most favorable to them, the actions of the police officers are conscience shocking in a
constitutional sense. At the very least, the police were deliberately indifferent to the safety of the
innocent people on the road that day and that will be sufficient to establish a substantive due
process violation. Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriff's Office, 329 F.3d 1300, 1305-1306 (11th
Cir. 2003). Additionally, it can be shown that Defendants Brioso, Gonzalez and/or Duarte acted
with a purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of an arrest. Lewis, 118 S.Ct. at
1711.

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 3 of 14

It is clear that the City of Sweetwater Police Officers Duarte, Brioso, Gonzalez, and
Benito violated Juan Perez’s substantive due process rights. The defense argues that no
Sweetwater officer ever engaged in any pursuit. [DE 70 p. 4]. This assertion is completely
contradicted by the evidence. The evidence is clear that Benito was sitting in his car with the car
on when Torrealba first went back to the Mercedes. (Gonzalez Stmt. p. 12, Brioso Stmt. p. 16,
Duarte Stmt. p. 10, Benito Stmt. p. 10, Gonzalez Dep. p. 77, Brioso Dep. p. 63-64, Radio
Dispatch Transcript p. 4). Benito’s own radio communications and the statements of the other
officers confirm that Benito initiated a chase. (Brioso Stmt. p. 16, Gonzalez Stmt. p. 12, Duarte
Stmt. p. 10, Radio Dispatch Transcript p.4). Officer Benito was not the only officer who
followed the Mercedes in his car, in fact, on the date of the incident when Rafael Duarte’s first
sworn statement was taken, he states that “Officer Benito takes off after them and then so does
Brioso and Gonzalez.” (Duarte Stmt. p. 10 l. 5-6).
The intent to harm is evidenced by the fact that the officers were aware that Torrealba
was unarmed and that they had no authority to conduct any investigation. Relying on the
versions of the civilian witnesses, the police illegally detained Torrealba and St. Phar. The
police thoroughly searched them and the car and were aware that they were unarmed. (Benito
Dep. p. 15, 53, Benito Stmt. p. 7, Duarte Dep. p. 42, 45, Duarte Stmt. p. 5, Torrealba Dec. ¶ 4).
Torrealba was outside his car with his hands in the air immediately before Gonzalez and Brioso
opened fire on him. (Perez Dep. p. 133-134). No officers or civilians were in harm’s way,
nobody was threatened by him, yet they intended to kill Torrealba. (Brioso Dep. p. 63, Gonzalez
Dep. p. 76). Shooting 23 times at an unarmed traffic offender onto a trafficked thoroughfare
while simultaneously chasing him with a police vehicle clearly shows an intent to harm unrelated
to a legitimate governmental objective. So long as a constitutional violation by a Sweetwater

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 4 of 14

officer can be found, the City of Sweetwater can be held liable if the remaining conditions are
satisfied.
II.

Sweetwater is liable because of unconstitutional policy or custom
a. Unconstitutional policy or custom

A municipality can be held liable for violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if the civil rights
violation resulted from a policy or custom of the government. Monell v. New York City
Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (1978). This liability can exist
where a persistent and widespread discriminatory practice is not a formal written policy, or even
where the custom is contrary to written policy. Id. at 691. “In other words, a longstanding and
widespread practice is deemed authorized by the policymaking officials because they must have
known about it but failed to stop it.” Brown v. City of Ft. Laud., 923 F.2d 1474, 1481 (11th
Cir.1991). The police pursuit in this case, by the officer who pursued, is a practice that was
trained to do and encouraged to do.
The City of Sweetwater maintains a written policy that provides: “Officers may engage
in pursuit when they have reasonable belief that the fleeing suspect has committed or attempted
to commit a violent felony. ALL OTHER PURSUITS ARE PROHIBITED.” (Sweetwater SOP
7.02, BS 00001103) emphasis in original. That policy is what is supposed to be implemented
and followed. The City of Sweetwater, however, has been shown to disregard those policies
entirely. Corporal Benito himself illustrates the custom that was common and endorsed by the
City. In fact, this was not the first time that Benito engaged in a high speed chase with a person
whom he was not aware committed a violent felony. When Benito was being trained in 2009, he
was in the car with Ofc. Demurias when he began to follow a vehicle that refused to stop for
another Sweetwater Police Officer. Demurias and Benito began following the vehicle on 97th

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 5 of 14

avenue and 8th Street, even though they had not been advised of any felony having been
committed by the driver or occupants and even though it was outside of their jurisdiction. It was
not until they followed the vehicle for 8 blocks to 97th avenue and 16th street (approximately the
same amount of time it took for Felipe Torrealba to crash into Juan Perez) that they were advised
to stop pursuing the vehicle. Officers Demurias and Benito continued to follow the car until they
were later advised of the occupant’s potential involvement in a felony. They continued the
pursuit that to 97th avenue and 24th Street where the vehicle lost control and rolled over. (MDPD
Case # 09001032 Demurias Report). Benito and Demurias were not reprimanded or admonished
for this vehicular pursuit, instead, Benito was commended. (Commendation BS 00000145).
On another occasion, Benito and another Sweetwater officer, Lieutenant Ignacio
Menocal, were involved in another high speed chase that led them through Kendall ending up in
Medley, and also resulted in the subject of the pursuit being involved in an accident. (Benito
Dep. p. 38-40). It is clear that the written policy contained in the Standard Operating Procedures
was completely disregarded and the actual policy in effect was that it was acceptable and
encouraged to follow an offender at all costs for any reason. There is ample evidence to establish
a custom or policy of allowing improper police pursuits in the City of Sweetwater and that this
unofficial policy was so widespread that it was deemed authorized by the policy-making officials
since they did not attempt to stop the improper pursuits.
a. Failure to Train
Municipality liability flowing from a policy or custom under § 1983 may be based on the
inadequacy of police training where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the
rights of persons with whom the police come into contact. City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S.
378, 109 S. Ct. 1197 (1989); Lewis v. City of W. Palm Beach, Fla., 561 F.3d 1288, 1293 (11th

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 6 of 14

Cir.2009). In order to meet this “deliberate indifference” standard, a plaintiff must allege that
“the municipality knew of a need to train and/or supervise in a particular area and the
municipality made a deliberate choice not to take any action.” Gold v. City of Miami, 151 F.3d
1346, 1350 (11th Cir.1998); Rivas v. Figueroa, 11-23195-CIV, 2012 WL 1378161, at *2 (S.D.
Fla. 2012).
As it relates to vehicular pursuits, this is not merely a case of the City not training their
officers; there is evidence that the City encouraged these pursuits regardless of the possibility of
harm to any other citizens. The City knew that their officers were engaging in high speed
pursuits. More specifically, the City knew that Benito had engaged in high speed pursuits that
resulted in vehicular accidents. Despite this, the City did not take any action to train Benito or
any of the other officers on their proper procedures.
Similarly, the shooting officers were not properly trained on the City’s policy against
shooting into moving vehicles. The written policy specifically provides that an officer is
unauthorized to use a firearm by…”A: Firing into the air or ground in an attempt to halt a fleeing
criminal; B. Firing at a person who has been ordered to halt and simply continues walking or
runs away; C. Police Officers shall not discharge his firearm to effect an arrest or to stop the
fight (sic) of a person who has committed a misdemeanor; D. Firing at or into moving vehicles.”
(Sweetwater SOP 1.21.2, BS 00001025). Despite these limitations being specifically included in
the handbook, Officers Gonzalez and Brioso were unaware that their conduct was prohibited.
They were unaware of any policy at all in the City regarding shooting at moving vehicles.
(Gonzalez Dep. p. 33, Brioso Dep. p. 65). A policy that is in place to protect from the very
injury that Juan Perez suffered. Generally, a police department will prohibit officers from firing
at moving vehicles in order to protect the safety of the other innocent people in the area. When

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 7 of 14

shots are fired at a driver of car, innocent lives are needlessly endangered. (Taylor Dep. p. 115).
The City of Sweetwater’s failure to train Gonzalez and Brioso properly on the safe and accepted
procedures to follow with regard to their firearms was the moving force behind their actions and
the resulting injuries to Juan Perez. (Taylor Report p. 5).
The policy in effect at the time in the City of Sweetwater for sworn members who
discharge their firearms “ intentionally, requires a verbal report shall be made to the On-Duty
Supervisor immediately and as soon as possible a written report with all the details should be
made to the Chief of Police via chain of command.” (Sweetwater SOP 1.21.3, BS 00001025).
Neither Gonzalez nor Brioso knew of the policy requiring an officer who discharges a firearm to
file a written report. (Gonzalez Dep. p. 94-95, Brioso Dep. p. 77-78). Neither of them followed
the official policy. In fact, Brioso did not even report the incident to the supervisor despite him
having fired his weapon at least 14 times. (Brioso Dep. p. 77). The City did not properly train
their officers regarding their official policies and they did not require them to comply with the
official policies.
On June 13, 2017, two former Sweetwater Police Department officers were arrested on
racketeering, fraud and conspiracy charges, related to their conduct while on duty. The
Affidavit in Support of the Arrest Warrant in their case includes information from the
investigation by the FDLE into the Sweetwater Police Department and the City of Sweetwater
Administration during the period of time immediately before and after the incident involved in
our case. The Affidavit states - there existed within the Sweetwater Police Department (SWP) “a
pattern of criminal conduct under color of law that spanned many years and affected many
victims”. This pattern within the SWP was part of a “culture of corruption that permeated all
aspects of the City of Sweetwater” The corruption included collusion between the Mayor of the

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 8 of 14

City, the SWP, and others within and outside the City to profit from the unlawful stop and illegal
seizure of vehicles from unsuspecting motorists. Specifically there existed “a culture of
corruption throughout the SWP with sworn and unsworn officers while operating under color of
law engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that included multiple acts of theft, fraud,
burglary, torture an other violent crimes against civilians, often targeting foreign born victims …
in order to … conceal the officers’ unlawful activity from outside authorities.” 1
The incidents that the affidavit speaks of regarding illegal stops is eerily similar of the
illegal traffic stop in this case, both Mr. Torrealba (latino) and Mr. St. Phar (Haitian) are foreignborn. Framed with the backdrop of this new information there is evidence to suggest that this
vehicle stop was made in furtherance of the City sponsored illegal activities and corruption.
III.

Common law negligence
a. No pursuit/ no liability

When analyzing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff, it is clear that at
least one police officer and likely three police officers from the City of Sweetwater engaged in a
vehicular pursuit. As such, this Court must apply the criteria set out in Fl. Stat. 768(9)(d) to our
facts in order to determine the City of Sweetwater’s liability. When officers engage in hot
pursuit, it is an operational function that is not immune from liability if accomplished in a
manner contrary to reason and public safety. City of Pinellas Park v. Brown, 604 So. 2d 1222,
1227 (Fla. July 23, 1992). Section 768.28(9)(d), Florida Statutes, provides:
The employing agency of a law enforcement officer as defined in s. 943.10 is not
liable for injury, death, or property damage effected or caused by a person fleeing
from a law enforcement officer in a motor vehicle if:

1

See Appendix – Affidavit in Support of Arrest Warrant for former Sweetwater Police Officers
William Garcia and Remy Garcia.

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 9 of 14

1. The pursuit is conducted in a manner that does not involve conduct by the
officer which is so reckless or wanting in care as to constitute disregard of human
life, human rights, safety, or the property of another;
2. At the time the law enforcement officer initiates the pursuit, the officer
reasonably believes that the person fleeing has committed a forcible felony as
defined in s. 776.08; and
3. The pursuit is conducted by the officer pursuant to a written policy governing
high-speed pursuit adopted by the employing agency. The policy must contain
specific procedures concerning the proper method to initiate and terminate highspeed pursuit. The law enforcement officer must have received instructional
training from the employing agency on the written policy governing high speed
pursuit
Benito, Brioso and Gonzalez were clearly reckless and wanting in care and evidenced a
disregard of human life when they decided to engage in a pursuit of Torrealba. The strongest
piece of evidence that points to the recklessness of the pursuit is the statements by Benito himself
on the radio. (Radio Dispatch Recording). He first reports that he is following the vehicle going
eastbound on the trail, then he reports shots fired. (Radio Dispatch Transcript p. 4). The
vehicular pursuit appeared to have already begun when the shots were fired. There is nothing
more reckless or wanting in care than unloading multiple shots into a trafficked main street while
simultaneously following the target with a police cruiser. The danger of harm to innocent people
in the area is almost definite. The evidence of such is the accident that occurred with the
Mercedes and four other vehicles and another person whose car was struck by a stray police
bullet.
Evaluating the evidence in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the second requirement
of Fl. Stat. 768.28(9)(d) is also met. The Sweetwater police officers had no reason to believe that
Felipe Torrealba had committed a forcible felony. At most, he was a fleeing misdemeanant or
fleeing traffic offender. The officer’s assert that they believed that Torrealba pointed a gun at
them but the only evidence of that is their own conflicting testimony. Gonzalez was the only

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 10 of 14

police officer who reported seeing a gun initially and the first time any statement is taken from
him is in February, over a month after the incident occurred. (Gonzalez Stmt. p.11). Duarte, who
in the police version of facts would have been the closest to Torrealba, at most recalls seeing the
grip of a firearm in his waistband when he was already inside the car. (Duarte Stmt. p. 8). Of
course, when Duarte’s deposition was taken five years after the incident, he recalls seeing the
entire gun pointed directly at him. (Duarte Dep. p. 51-52).
Additionally, the evidence shows that Torrealba was patted down and his car was
thoroughly searched. (Torrealba Dec. ¶ 4, Benito Dep. p. 15, 53, Benito Stmt. p. 7, Duarte Stmt.
p. 5, Duarte Dep. p. 42, 45). Gonzalez and Brioso would have known that Torrealba was
unarmed because they made sure of it. The officers then claim that Duarte was dragged and that
justified their use of deadly force and the pursuit, however, this allegation is in dispute. On the
very day of the incident, the passenger of the car, Dondrey St. Phar says that he was in a position
to see Torrealba get in the car and he never saw any officer get dragged. (St. Phar Stmt. p. 10),
Torrealba himself states that he never dragged any officer with his car. (Torrealba Dec. ¶ 7). The
allegation that there was a warrant out for Torrealba’s arrest or his subsequent warrants are not
relevant to this inquiry. The police officers had no knowledge of these outstanding or
subsequent warrants when they engaged in the pursuit. (Brioso Stmt. p. 10, Gonzalez Stmt. p. 6,
Brioso Dep. 49-50). There is clearly evidence that suggests that the Sweetwater police officers
engaged in a vehicular pursuit with a person who had not committed a forcible felony.
The third and final element in the Fl. Stat. 768.28(9)(d) analysis is similarly satisfied.
The Sweetwater police officers were not acting pursuant to the written policy because they had
not been appropriately trained on that policy. The evidence shows that as part of the training, a
training officer engaged in conduct almost identical to that which caused these life altering

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 11 of 14

injuries to Juan Perez. (MDPD Case # 09001032 Demurias Report). The City of Sweetwater
commended that action despite their official policy. It is clear that vehicular pursuits were
encouraged and commendable regardless of what crime, if any, they had committed and
regardless if the pursuit began outside their own jurisdiction.
b. Sweetwater is not immune from suit
Should this court find that there was no pursuit or that the pursuit was not conducted in a
way that evidenced a wanton and willful disregard for human safety, the City of Sweetwater is
still liable. It is the Plaintiffs’ position that the City of Sweetwater and the Defendant officers are
both liable as the actions of the officers were willful and wanton and exhibited a willful disregard
for the safety of the people in the area and they engaged in a pursuit of someone who had not
committed a forcible felony, consequently their actions do not create an immunity for
Sweetwater or its officers based on Fl. Stat. 768.28(9)(a) and 786.28 (9)(d). However, even if
this court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the bad faith of the officers’
actions and grants summary judgment as to the officers individually on the state law claims, the
City of Sweetwater should still be liable for their officer’s negligence on a theory of respondeat
superior.
The State of Florida has waived sovereign immunity in tort actions to a certain extent so a
Florida municipality may be liable in respondeat superior for the tortious conduct of its
employees, Richardson v. City of Pompano Beach, 511 So.2d 1121, 1123–24
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1987). If this court finds that the police officers conduct was negligent but not
willful and wanton or deliberately indifferent to the safety of those in the area, the police officers
may be entitled to individual immunity, but Plaintiffs can still seek damages against the police

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 12 of 14

officer's governmental employer (i.e. the City). Willingham v. City of Orlando, 929 So. 2d 43,
47-48 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006).
Moreover, sovereign immunity is not applicable at all on this case. Sovereign immunity is
only applicable to discretionary decisions of governmental agencies for planning level functions
not operational level functions. Kaisner v. Kolb, 543 So.2d 732, 737 (Fla.1989). A
“discretionary” function is one in which “the governmental act in question involved an exercise
of executive or legislative power such that, for the court to intervene by way of tort law, it
inappropriately would entangle itself in fundamental questions of policy and planning.” Cook v.
Sheriff of Monroe Cnty., 402 F.3d 1092, 1117–18 (11th Cir.2005). An “operational” function is
not inherent in policy or planning but merely reflects a secondary decision as to how those
policies or plans will be implemented, and is not entitled to sovereign immunity. Id. at 1118.
“[W]hen an officer has made an initial discretionary decision to conduct a stop and then proceeds
to carry out that decision, the officer is no longer exercising a ‘discretionary’ function, but is
engaged in an ‘operational’ task.” Lewis v. City of St. Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th
Cir.2001) (citing Kaisner, 543 So.2d at 734, 737–38). Likewise, the decision as to whether use of
a firearm is necessary is ‘not necessary to or inherent in policy or planning,’ as is the decision to
initiate a vehicular pursuit and ‘merely reflects a secondary decision as to how those policies or
plans will be implemented.’ ” Id. at 1264 (quoting Kaisner, 543 So.2d at 737). Brown v. City of
Pinellas Park. 557 So.2d 161 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990) (the precise manner in which a police chase is
implemented is not a policy making decision).
With regard to Plaintiffs' state law negligence claims against the City, there are several issues
of fact that preclude granting summary judgment based on sovereign immunity. Whether the
police were justified in responding aggressively to the situation and subsequently initiating a

Case 1:16-cv-24267-CMA Document 80 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/13/2017 Page 13 of 14

high speed vehicular pursuit of Torrealba is a genuine issue of material fact that should be left to
the jury. When the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the record supports
Plaintiffs' allegations that Torrealba and the passenger complied with police orders for a
significant amount of time during the illegal stop and detention; Torrealba, the passenger and the
car were searched and Torrealba was unarmed; and Torrealba had his hands up when he was next
to the driver side door of the car and his hands were empty. Accepting these facts, a trier of fact
could reasonably conclude that at the time Gonzalez and Brioso discharged their firearms, no
pressing threat existed requiring the use of deadly force to protect the public. Furthermore, at the
time Benito began the initial chase, no forcible felony had been committed that would justify the
risk a vehicular pursuit would pose to the public. The officers actions were, at the very least,
negligent. Their negligence creates liability for the City of Sweetwater.
IV.

Loss of Consortium

Because there is genuine issues of material fact for Juan Perez’s claims to survive
summary judgment, so too should Maria Posada’s derivative claims. Courts have held that if the
husband maintains a cause of action against the Defendants, the consortium claims should
proceed. See Cook v. Waters, No. 96–cv–1459–T–17E, 1996 WL 685842, at *1 (M.D.Fla.
Nov.13, 1996) (holding consortium claim unavailable under Title VII and ADA); Doran v. City
of Clearwater, Fla., 814 F.Supp. 1079, (M.D.Fla.1993) (permitting consortium claim in case
involving both claims under § 1983 and state law defamation, because claim could have derived
from the state law claim). Crawford v. City of Tampa, 8:08-CV-927-T-26EAJ, 2009 WL 64905,
at *2 (M.D. Fla. 2009), aff'd in part, rev'd in part and remanded, 397 Fed. Appx. 621 (11th Cir.
2010).
