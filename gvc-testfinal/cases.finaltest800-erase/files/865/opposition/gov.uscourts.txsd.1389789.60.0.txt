DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
TO THE COURT:
COME NOW in personam Defendants Amerindo Services Ltd. and Blue Sky Langsa Ltd.,
filing their Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and respectfully would
show:
I.
SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED . R. CIV . P. 56©).
The movant has the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,
and must establish each element of its claim as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.
317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986). The Court should grant the motion only if, viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, there are no genuine disputes of material fact.
Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2110 (2000). To avoid

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 2 of 9

summary judgment, the nonmovant then must introduce evidence of “[s]pecific facts showing that
there is a genuine issue for trial.” FED . R. CIV . P. 56(e); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.
242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2502, 2510 (1986). “Hearsay, conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated
assertions, and unsupported speculation are not competent summary judgment evidence.” Oldham
v. Thompson/Ctr. Arms Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. Lexis 111709 at *11-12 (S.D. Tex. 2013)(citations
omitted). When there are two opposing versions of the facts, if one is blatantly contradicted by the
record, the court cannot adopt that version for summary judgment purposes. E.g. Scott v. Harris,
550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007).
Review of a summary judgment is de novo. Hasty v. Trans Atlas Boats, Inc., 389 F.3d 510,
512 (5th Cir. 2004).
II.
ATTORNEY’S FEES NOT AVAILABLE
Interpretation of contract terms is a question of law for the court. Weathersby v. Conoco
Oil Co., 752 F.2d 953, 956 (5th Cir. 1984). Under maritime law, “an indemnity agreement ...
should be read as a whole and its words given their plain meaning unless the provision is
ambiguous. Disagreement as to the meaning of a contract does not make it ambiguous, nor does
uncertainty or lack of clarity in the language chosen by the parties.” Breaux v. Halliburtan
Energy Servs., 562 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir. 2009) (citations and quotations omitted). Additionally,
[a] contract of indemnity should be construed to cover all losses, damages, or liabilities
which reasonably appear to have been within the contemplation of the parties, but it
should not be read to impose liability for those losses or liabilities which are neither
expressly within the terms nor of such a character that it can be reasonably inferred that
the parties intended to include them within the indemnity coverage. Thus, for example, it
is widely held that a contract of indemnity will not afford protection to an indemnitee
against the consequences of his own negligent act unless the contract clearly expresses
-2-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 3 of 9

such an obligation in unequivocal terms.
Corbitt v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 654 F.2d 329, 333 (5th Cir. Unit A Aug. 1981) (citations
omitted).
Furthermore, “[i]t is established that while an indemnitee may recover from his
indemnitor attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in defending a claim as to which he is
indemnified, he may not recover fees and expenses incurred to establish his right against the
indemnitor. Peter Fabrics, Inc. v. S.S. Hermes, 765 F.2d 306, 316 (2d Cir. 1985), citing E.C.
Ernst, Inc. v. Manhattan Constr. Co., 551 F.2d 1026, 1037 (5th Cir. 1977); see also In re Oil
Spill, 841 F.Supp.2d 988, 1007-08 (E.D. La. 2012). The reasoning for this is simple. “Indemnity
obligations, whether imposed by contract or law, require the indemnitor to hold the indemnitee
harmless from costs in connection with a particular class of claims.” Peter Fabrics, 765 F.2d at
316. Expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred while defending an indemnified claim are one such
cost that fall squarely within the indemnity obligation. Id. Therefore, it follows that legal fees
incurred in defending against liability claims are included as part of the indemnity obligation, and
reimbursement of these fees is part of what was intended by the draftsman of the contract unless
the contract states otherwise. Id.
However, the above reasoning does not apply to fees and expenses incurred in
establishing the existence of an obligation to indemnify, since such expenses are not by their
nature a part of the claim indemnified against. Simply put, they are expenses incurred is suing
for breach of contract, or the failure to indemnify. Id. “As such, fees and expenses incurred in
establishing the indemnity obligation fall within the ordinary rule requiring a party to bear his
own expenses of litigation. Id. (citations omitted). Stated another way, “[u]nder a general

-3-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 4 of 9

indemnity agreement, the indemnitee enjoys no right to recover its legal fees incurred in
establishing its right to indemnification.” In re Oil Spill, 841 F.Supp.2d at 1007 (citations
omitted).
In light of the foregoing, the question the Court must answer is whether the indemnity
provision in the Layberth Agreement (Clause 10.2) is a general indemnity agreement that does
not allow for the recovery of fees, or whether the Court concludes as a matter of law that the
provision contains express language allowing for recovery of legal fees for establishing the right
to indemnity from the Defendants.1
Clause 10.2 states: OWNER’S INDEMNITY. OWNER2 HEREBY AGREES FULLY TO
RELEASE, PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS
SHIPYARD (including its parents, affiliates, contractors, subcontractors of any tier, and
each of its and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees,
successors-in-interest, invitees and assigns) (collectively the “Shipyard Group”) from and
against any and all demands, claims, losses, costs, suits, or causes of action (including,
but not limited to, any judgments, losses, liabilities, expenses, interest, legal fees, costs of
suit, and damages, whether in law, equity, or admiralty, and whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) (“Claims”) arising out of or in any way related to (a) injuries (or death) of any

1

There is no other provision in the Layberth Agreement that expressly allows for
recovery of attorney’s fees to a prevailing party in litigation. As the Court is no doubt aware,
these provisions are commonplace, and state words to the effect that in the event of a dispute
under the contract, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees from the other
party. This type of provision could have easily been written into the contract, but was not. The
fact that no such provision exists must be considered in reviewing the indemnity provision
because the contract must be read as a whole.
2

Owner means the Defendants. [Dkt. No. 54-3 at p. 6 of 89].
-4-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 5 of 9

member of Owner Group (b) a breach by Owner under the terms of this Agreement or ©)
damage to the property of any member of the Owner Group. THE RELEASE,
PROTECTION, DEFENSE, INDEMNITY, AND HOLD HARMLESS RIGHTS
AFFORDED UNDER THIS SECTION 10.2 SHALL PROTECT AND INDEMNIFY
THE MEMBERS OF THE SHIPYARD GROUP AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR OTHER BREACH OF LEGAL DUTY AND THE UNSEAWORTHINESS OF THE
VESSEL.
Simply put, this provision is a general indemnity provision like those found in
Weathersby, Peter Fabrics, and In re Oil Spill, so attorney’s fees are not recoverable.
Weathersby, 752 F.2d at 954-55; Peter Fabrics, 765 F.2d at 316; In re Oil Spill, 841 F.Supp.2d at
1008. As was stated by the court in Peter Fabrics, just because the indemnity clause contains the
phrase “including but not limited to costs of suit and attorney’s fees,” so that attorneys’ fees are
included in the expenses indemnified against, that by itself cannot be viewed “as causing a
shifting of fees in an action to establish the obligation to indemnify.” 765 F.2d at 316.
The indemnity provision under which Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees (Clause 10.2) is a
general indemnity clause. It does not contain the required explicit, clear language allowing for
recovery of attorney’s fees by Plaintiff indemnitee under the circumstances of this case. For the
foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion, on its request for attorneys’ fees, should be denied.
III.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE
In addition to seeking damages for berthing fees while the ATP INNOVATOR remains at

-5-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 6 of 9

the berth, Plaintiff seeks to enforce a liquidated damages clause in the Layberth Agreement
(Clause 11.3). As an initial matter, this clause depends upon the agreement being terminated.
The affidavit of Todd Ladd attached to Plaintiff’s motion contains no evidence as to whether and
when the agreement was terminated. Consequently, there is a fact question as to the application
of the clause. Further, the ATP INNOVATOR has been under arrest since October of 2016, so it
is impossible for the owner of the ATP INNOVATOR to move the structure. These issues alone
preclude summary judgment on the issue.
Nevertheless, under the maritime law in the Fifth Circuit, the question of whether a
liquidated damages clause if a penalty is a question of law. Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. 27,946 Long
Tons of Corn, 830 F.2d 1321, 1331 (5th Cir. 1987). To determine whether the clause is so large
as to be a penalty, the Fifth Circuit applies the two part test from the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 356 comment b. Int’l Marine, L.L.C. v. Delta Towing, L.L.C., 704 F.3d 350, 354
(5th Cir. 2013). The test has been explained as follows:
The first factor is the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach. The amount fixed is
reasonable if it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from a particular breach,
even though it may not approximate the loss that might have been anticipated under other
possible situations, or if the breach approximates the loss anticipated at the time of
making the contract, even though it does not approximate the actual loss. The second
factor is the difficulty of proof of loss. The greater the difficulty of proof of loss, the
more flexibility is allowed in approximating the anticipated or actual harm.
Id., quoting Farmers Exp. Co. v. M/V GEORGIS PROIS, 799 F.2d 159, 162 (5th Cir. 1986).
The number of cases in the Fifth Circuit that have discussed the test is limited. The first

-6-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 7 of 9

such case is Farmers Export. In that case, the Fifth Circuit upheld a damages award of $5,000.00
per hour as reasonable and not a penalty. To reach this conclusion, the appellate court relied
upon the trial court’s factual finding that $5,000.00 was a reasonable forecast of the facility
owner’s damages, which was based upon expert testimony on the issue. 799 F.2d at 164-65. We
have no such evidence here. All we have here is the clause itself, which states that there “may”
be damages. There is simply no evidence before this Court as to what Plaintiff’s damages could
be, or would be, which in and of itself precludes summary judgment under the reasoning applied
in Farmers Export.
The second case is Louis Dreyfus. In that case, the Fifth Circuit refused to enforce a
liquidated damages clause that imposed a $30,000.00 per day charge to a ship that failed to
vacate the berth. The charge was excessive because the vessel occupied the berth for shorter than
the full day. 830 F.2d at 1332. Where the charge is excessive in relation to the damages that will
actually follow, the clause is unreasonable.
A more recent case is St. James Stevedoring Partners, LLC v. Motion Navigation Ltd.,
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108275 (E.D. La. August 6, 2014).3 In that case, the Plaintiff sought to
impose a liquidated damages provision in its tariff of $5,000 per hour for the time the ship was in
the berth after it was asked to leave the berth. Id. at *54. Because there were no vessels waiting
for the berth when the ship was ordered to vacate, and thus no possibility of a detention fee being
incurred, the dock owner was not exposed to any damages, and was not losing any other potential
income. As such, because the liquidated damages clause being applied did not approximate the
owner’s actual damages, the liquidated damages clause was unjustified and was an unreasonable
3

See Ex. A attached.
-7-

Case 2:16-cv-00430 Document 60 Filed in TXSD on 04/20/17 Page 8 of 9

penalty. Id. at *54-55.
Here, we have no evidence that the Plaintiff was going to lose any money or be subject to
any damages for the ATP INNOVATOR being at the berth. What we do know is that the ATP
INNOVATOR has been charged a berthing fee and additional expenses while at the berth. The
berthing fee itself is $55,000.00 per month, which means roughly $1,833.33 per day assuming a
30 day month. To charge a liquidated damages of $100,000.00 for unspecified damages that
“may” occur is to impose an unreasonable penalty on the Defendants, particularly since the
Plaintiff is charging a berthing fee and other expenses while the structure is there, whether
through direct invoicing or expenses in custodia legis. In essence, to allow liquidated damages
on top of actual expenses would allow Plaintiff a windfall in the form of an unwarranted double
recovery, particularly when Plaintiff presents this Court with no evidence of any actual damage.
Because there is no evidence to support the imposition of the liquidated damages clause to
counter any potential actual damages the Plaintiff faces, or any loss being incurred by the
Plaintiff, summary judgment is improper on the liquidated damages clause.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, in personam Defendants Amerindo
Services Ltd. and Blue Sky Langsa Ltd. pray the Court deny Plaintiff’s motion, in whole or in
part, and for such other relief to which they may be justly entitled.
