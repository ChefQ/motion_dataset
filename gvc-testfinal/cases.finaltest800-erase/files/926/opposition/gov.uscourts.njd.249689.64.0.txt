I, Joyce Mizerak, the undersigned, make this affidavit based upon my
own personal knowledge and a review of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s
("Chase") business records relating to the mortgage loans listed on Exhibit A
to the Second Amended Complaint in this action.

ii Iam currently employed by Chase as a First Vice President.

2: Each of the certificates listed in Exhibit A to the Second
Amended Complaint pertains to mortgage loans originated by Chase or

Washington Mutual Bank ("Washington Mutual") or purchased by them

from a third-party originator.
Case 2:10-cv-06141-WJM-MF Document 64 Filed 07/02/12 Page 2 of 2 PagelD: 1639

3s The originated loans were covered by insurance policies issued
by Republic Mortgage Insurance Company ("RMIC") to Chase or
Washington Mutual, and the purchased loans were covered by similar
policies issued to the third-party originators that originated the loans.

4. To the best of my knowledge and belief, none of the loans listed
on Exhibit A to the Second Amended Complaint were purchased from Bear
Stearns Residential Mortgage Corp. Accordingly, none of the loans listed on

Exhibit A to the Second Amended Complaint were covered by any policy

issued to Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage Corp.

Further deponent sayeth not.
