The United States moves to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint for lack of subject matter

Larson’s income tax liability that would result by treating the partnership items of Prestop
Holdings, LLC, consistently with the adjustments made by the Notice of Final Partnership
Administrative Adjustment (“FPAA”) that is at issue in this case. The Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) has computed that amount to be $835,687, exclusive of penalties and interest. Larson
has deposited only $100. In support of its motion, the United States relies on the following
memorandum, the Declaration of George J. Terpack, Jr. (“Terpack Decl.”), contained in
Appendix B to this motion, and the exhibits attached to the Declaration.
QUESTIONS PRESENTED
I. Whether this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint, because the
jurisdictional requirement of § 6226(e)(1) requires a partner who petitions for judicial review of
an FPAA to deposit the amount by which the FPAA would increase his tax liability for all years
affected by the FPAA, and the deposit made in this case falls short of that amount.
II. Whether the gross disparity between the “deposit” in this case and the tax liability
computed consistently with the adjustments made by the FPAA is indicative of bad faith.

INTRODUCTION
Prestop Holdings, LLC, engaged in a variation of the “Son of Boss” tax shelter involving
the short sale of U.S. Treasury securities. In this type of shelter, a partner enters into a short sale
of U.S. Treasury securities, thereby receiving the proceeds of the sale, subject to an obligation to
replace the securities at a later date. The partner then contributes the short sale position to the
partnership, and the proceeds from the short sale are eventually used to satisfy the short sale
obligation. After the contribution, the partner claims an inflated basis in his partnership interest,
positing that the contributed proceeds increased his basis but that the corresponding obligation to
replace the securities did not decrease his basis. Through other provisions of the Tax Code, the
partner transfers the inflated basis of his partnership interest to a low value asset. Ultimately, the
partner sells the low value asset and uses the inflated basis to claim an artificial loss from the
sale. The Federal Circuit recently disallowed a loss generated by such a shelter, holding that the
rules governing the calculation of partnership basis require the contributing partner to reduce the
basis of his partnership interest by the amount of the short sale obligation. See Marriott Int’l
Resorts, L.P. v. United States, ____ F.3d ____, 2009 WL 3447443 at *1 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (per
curiam).
Here, plaintiff, the JL Investment Trust, contributed a short sale of U.S. Treasury
Securities to a partnership in 1997, but did not complete the Son of Boss transaction until 1998,
when it sold the low value asset (shares of stock) with the transferred, inflated basis generated by
the short sale contribution. As a result, 1998 was the year in which plaintiff claimed the artificial
loss of $2.6 million through the shelter transaction. The claimed loss passed through to the
trust’s grantor, John M. Larson, thereby reducing his tax liability in 1998, and then was carried

-3-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 10 of 28

forward to reduce Larson’s tax liability in the years 2000 and 2001. In 2004, the IRS issued an
FPAA to Prestop for 1997, adjusting the partnership’s return to prevent the basis inflation
claimed by plaintiff on account of the shelter transaction.
Plaintiff now seeks a readjustment of the partnership items adjusted by the FPAA. As a
jurisdictional prerequisite to such a suit, the petitioning partner (and, in the case of a passthrough partner, all indirect partners holding partnership interests through the petitioning
partner) must deposit the amount by which his tax liability would increase if computed
consistently with the FPAA adjustments. In the case of a shortfall in the deposit amount, if the
Court finds that the petitioning partner made a good faith attempt to satisfy the deposit
requirement, and the partner timely corrects the shortfall, the Court may order that the
jurisdictional prerequisite to the suit has been satisfied.
Here, the FPAA adjustments would ultimately eliminate the $2.6 million of losses
plaintiff has claimed, increasing Larson’s tax liability for 1998, 2000, and 2001 by a total of
approximately $836,000. Larson has deposited only $100, however, reasoning that the FPAA
adjustments would have no effect on his tax liability for the year for which the FPAA was
issued – 1997.
While the FPAA adjustments to the partnership’s 1997 return don’t affect Larson’s tax
liability in that year – since plaintiff did not claim the loss generated by the shelter until 1998 –
plaintiff is ignoring that the 1997 FPAA adjustments significantly increase his tax liability for
1998, 2000, and 2001. Plaintiff’s claim that a partner’s deposit requirement applies only with
respect to the tax effect to him for the same year as the year for which the FPAA was issued is
wrong and contrary to precedent in this Court. Rather, to maintain a suit challenging an FPAA,
-4-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 11 of 28

the petitioning partner (and, in the case of a pass-through partner, each of the indirect partners
holding an interest through the petitioning partner) must deposit the amount by which the FPAA
adjustments would increase his tax liability for all years affected by the FPAA.
Thus, Larson was required to deposit $836,000, the amount by which his tax liability
would increase as a result of the FPAA adjustments. The amount deposited, $100, does not even
approach the actual tax impact of the FPAA on Larson’s 1998, 2000, and 2001 liability.
(Neither does it reflect the tax impact in 1997, which would be zero). Rather, plaintiff has
merely deposited a nominal sum, corresponding to nothing. It reflects an effort to give lip
service to the jurisdictional deposit requirement; it is not a “good faith” effort to satisfy it. As a
result, the complaint should be dismissed.
AUTHORITIES INVOLVED
The pertinent portions of the authorities involved are set forth in Appendix A, infra.
STATEMENT
Plaintiff, the JL Investment Trust (“plaintiff” or “the Trust”), is a grantor trust, the
grantor of which is John M. Larson (“Larson”). As a grantor trust, plaintiff is a pass-through
entity, the income of which is taxed to Larson. See § 671 et seq. (Compl. ¶ 7.) In 1997, plaintiff
held a 50% partnership interest in Prestop Holdings, LLC (“Prestop” or the “partnership”).
I.

The Tax Shelter Transaction
On its U.S. Income Tax Return (Form 1041) for 1998, plaintiff claimed a short term

capital loss of $2,613,003 from the alleged February 6, 1998, sale of shares of stock in a
company called “Torpre.” (Ex. 4, App. B at B-28 (Schedule D, line 1).) As reported by

-5-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 12 of 28

plaintiff, the amount of the loss was the difference between the reported sales price of the
stock – $536,586 – and plaintiff’s alleged basis in the stock – $3,149,589. (Id.) In response to
the IRS’s subsequent information requests, plaintiff claimed that it had obtained the $3.1 million
basis in the stock as a transferred basis from plaintiff’s basis in its former partnership interest in
Prestop, upon plaintiff’s assignment of that partnership interest to Torpre. See §§ 351, 358. (Ex.
2, App. B at B-22; Ex. 3, App. B at B-23.) As grounds for claiming a $3.1 million basis in its
former partnership interest, plaintiff alleged that on December 22, 1997, it had entered into the
short sale of Treasury Notes, receiving proceeds of $3,074,589, and that on the same day,
plaintiff had transferred those proceeds along with an additional $75,000 to the partnership. (Ex.
3, App. B at B-23.) According to plaintiff, it thereby obtained a basis equal to the sum of the
short sale proceeds of $3,074,589 plus the additional $75,000 contribution to the partnership, or
approximately $3.1 million. (Id.)
With respect to the short term capital loss claimed on plaintiff’s 1998 return as a result of
the sale of the Torpre stock, plaintiff netted the amount of the loss ($2,613,003) against a
reported net short term gain from partnerships, S corporations and other estates of trusts of
$460,478, leaving $2,152,525 as a short term capital loss carryover into 1999. (Terpak Decl. ¶ 8;
Ex. 4, App. B at B-28 (Schedule D, lines 3, 5).)
Of that amount, plaintiff used $932,488 to offset short term gain reported on its 1999
income tax return (Form 1041) (Terpak Decl. ¶ 9; Ex.6, App. B at B-42 (Schedule D, lines 1, 3,
4)), and Larson used another $3,000 as a deduction from his ordinary income (Terpak Decl. ¶ 9;
Ex.6, App. B at B-43 (Schedule D, line 17); Ex. 7, App. B at B-51 (Line 13)), leaving
$1,217,037 as a short term capital loss carryover into 2000.

Filed 12/04/09 Page 13 of 28

On his income tax return (Form 1040) for 2000, Larson used (1) $34,393 of the short
term capital loss carryover from 1998 to offset short term capital gain (Terpak Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. 8,
App. B at B-74 (Schedule D, lines 1, 5)); (2) $570,158 of the short term capital loss carryover to
offset net long term capital gain (Terpak Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. 8, App. B at B-74 (Schedule D, line
16)); and (3) $3,000 of the short term capital loss carryover as a deduction from ordinary income
(Terpak Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. 8, App. B at B-69 (line 13); id. at B-75 (Schedule D, line 18)), leaving
$609,486 as a short term capital loss carryover available in 2001.
On Larson’s income tax return (Form 1040) for 2001, the short term capital loss
carryover from 1998 (claimed only in the amount of $598,456 for some unknown reason) was
combined with a net short term loss from partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trust in the
amount of $231,940. (Terpak Decl. ¶ 11; Ex. 9, App. B at B-104 (Schedule D, lines 5, 6).) The
combined short term capital loss of $830,396 was then netted against $7,202 in short term capital
gain and $1,387,791 in long term capital gain, leaving $564,597 in long term capital gain.
(Terpak Decl. ¶ 11; Ex. 9, App. B at B-104-105 (Schedule D, lines 1, 16, 17).)
II.

The FPAA
On December 27, 2004, the IRS issued an FPAA to the partnership for its taxable period

ending December 31, 1997. The IRS adjusted the partnership item referred to as “distributions –
property other than money” from zero, as originally reported on the partnership’s 1997 return, to
$6,149,178. (Ex. 1, App. B at B-14 (Schedule K, line 23); Ex. 10, App. B at B-134.) The FPAA
allocated $3,074,589 of the increased distributions to plaintiff. (Ex. 10, App. B at B-135.) As
grounds for the adjustment, the FPAA explained that obligations to close open short sales in U.S.
Treasury Securities constitute “partnership liabilities” within the meaning of § 752. (Id. at B-7-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 14 of 28

136.) The FPAA thus concluded that the partnership’s assumption of the obligation to close the
short sale contributed by each partner decreased the individual liabilities of that partner,
triggering a constructive distribution of cash under § 752(b). (Id.) See § 752(b) (“Any decrease
in a partner's share of the liabilities of a partnership, or any decrease in a partner’s individual
liabilities by reason of the assumption by the partnership of such individual liabilities, shall be
considered as a distribution of money to the partner by the partnership.” ).
As applied to Larson’s tax liability, the adjustment made by the FPAA would
(1) eliminate the entire short term capital loss claimed by plaintiff and passed through to Larson
in 1998, (2) create a short term capital gain of $461,586 for that year, and thus (3) increase
Larson’s tax liability for 1998, as well as for 2000 and 2001. (Terpack Decl. ¶¶ 14-18.) That is
because under the statutory rules for computing the basis of a partnership interest, the increase in
the amount of the partnership’s distributions to plaintiff would cause a proportional decrease in
plaintiff’s basis of its partnership interest. See § 733 (“In the case of a distribution by a
partnership to a partner other than in liquidation of a partner’s interest, the adjusted basis to such
partner of his interest in the partnership shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of
any money distributed to such partner . . . .”).
After that FPAA’s reduction, plaintiff would be left with a basis in its partnership interest
of $75,000 (i.e., $3,149,589 - $3,074,589). According to plaintiff’s basis transfer theory, that
$75,000 would become plaintiff’s basis in the Torpre stock, and plaintiff would realize a
$461,586 gain, rather than the originally reported $2.6 million loss, upon the sale of the stock in
1998 for $536,586. In turn, that adjustment would increase Larson’s tax liability for 1998 by
$374,708. (Terpack Decl. ¶ 14, 18.) The FPAA’s basis adjustment also would eliminate the

-8-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 15 of 28

capital loss carryovers Larson claimed in 2000 and 2001 on account of the 1998 loss, increasing
his tax liability for each year by $334,267 and $126,712, respectively. (Id. ¶ 15-18.)
Thus, the FPAA would cause an overall increase in Larson’s tax liability of $835,687,
exclusive of penalties and interest. (Id. ¶ 19.)
III.

The Complaint and the Deposit
Plaintiff filed the complaint with this Court on May 26, 2005. (“Compl.”). In the

complaint, plaintiff petitions for judicial review of the FPAA’s adjustments to Prestop’s
partnership items for Prestop’s taxable period ending December 31, 1997. (Id. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff
brought the complaint pursuant to § 6226(b).2 (Id. ¶ 3.) Before instituting this suit, Larson
deposited $100 with the IRS. (Compl. ¶ 11.)
ARGUMENT
I.

The Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over the Complaint Because Larson Has
Not Deposited the Entire Amount by which the FPAA Would Increase His Tax Liability
for All Affected Years
Section 6226, under which this suit arises, is part of “TEFRA,” the laws enacted by

Congress in 1982 to establish coordinated procedures for determining the proper treatment of
“partnership items” at the partnership level in a single, unified audit and judicial proceeding. See
Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (“TEFRA”), Pub. L. No. 97-248, § 402(a), 96
Stat. 324, 648-671, codified in §§ 6221-6233. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 97-760, 97th Cong., 2d
Sess. 599-600 (1982); Crnkovich v. United States, 202 F.3d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (per
curiam).

2

Although plaintiff is the Tax Matters Partner for the partnership, it filed the complaint in
its capacity as a notice partner only. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 3.

-9-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 16 of 28

TEFRA begins by establishing that the tax treatment of “any partnership item . . . shall be
determined at the partnership level.” § 6221. It then provides a series of partnership-level
procedures for the IRS, the partnership, or individual partners to adjust the treatment of
partnership items, and for the judicial review of any such adjustments. §§ 6223-6230. Under
§ 6223, the IRS can adjust the partnership items as reported by the partnership by issuing a
notice of final partnership administrative adjustment or “FPAA.” An individual partner can then
seek judicial review of the adjustments made by the FPAA under § 6226. Such a suit can be
brought in the Tax Court, a district court, or the Court of Federal Claims. § 6226(a).
As a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing such a suit in a district court or the Court of
Federal Claims, the filing partner is required to deposit “the amount by which the tax liability of
the partner would be increased if the treatment of partnership items on the partner’s return were
made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by
the final partnership administrative adjustment.” § 6226(e)(1). For civil actions beginning on or
after April 2, 2002, if the petition is filed by a pass-through partner, the deposit requirement
applies to “each indirect partner holding an interest through the pass-thru partner.” Treas. Reg.
(26 C.F.R.) § 301.6226(e)-1. The legislative history of TEFRA confirms that satisfying the
“deposit requirement” is “[a] condition to filing a petition in either the appropriate district court
or the claims court.” See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 97-760, at 603 (1982).
Here, Larson’s tax liability would be increased by $835,687 if the treatment of
partnership items on each return for 1997 through 2001 were made consistent with the treatment
of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the FPAA. He has deposited only

-10-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 17 of 28

$100, an amount that clearly is insufficient to reflect his increased tax liability by applying the
FPAA adjustments to him.
Plaintiff defends the sufficiency of Larson’s deposit by focusing only on 1997 and that
the FPAA would not increase his tax liability year. (Compl. ¶ 11, ex. B.). While Larson’s tax
liability for 1997 is not altered by the FPAA, plaintiff is mistaken that the amount of the required
deposit is determined only by reference to the partner’s tax year corresponding to the
partnership year adjusted by the FPAA. To the contrary, § 6226(e) requires the petitioning
partner to deposit the amount by which the FPAA adjustments would increase his tax liability for
all affected years. Kislev Partners, L.P. ex rel. Bahar v. United States, 84 Fed. Cl. 385, 390
(2008), reh’g denied, 84 Fed. Cl. 378 (2008).
As explained below, the court’s statutory analysis in Kislev Partners follows from
Section 6226(e)’s text and purpose, as well as case law interpreting analogous TEFRA
provisions.
A.

Plaintiff’s Interpretation Is Not Supported by the Statutory Text, Produces Odd
Results, and Would Defeat the Statute’s Purpose.

An FPAA’s adjustments may have no effect on a partner’s liability in the year
corresponding to the partnership year the FPAA adjusts, but will often increase the petitioning
partner’s tax liability for other years. For example, a partner may be unable to use a partnership
loss in the year it is claimed, but will claim it in a subsequent carry forward year. Or, as here, a
partnership item reported in one year may inflate the partner’s basis in his partnership interest
and hence create a loss in a subsequent year when the partner disposes of the interest. When that
happens, nothing in the text of the statute limits the amount of the required deposit to the

-11-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 18 of 28

increased tax liability of the partner for the year for which the FPAA was issued.3 Rather, the
statute refers to the “amount by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased.”
§ 6226(e)(1).
In Kislev, this Court interpreted that statutory phrase to include the increased tax liability
of the petitioning partner for all years affected by the FPAA. Kislev, 84 Fed. Cl. at 390. There,
the FPAA had disallowed losses claimed by the partnership in 2002. Id. at 387. The petitioning
partner had deducted a portion of those losses in 2002 and had carried the remainder forward to
deduct in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Id. After depositing the amount of the increased tax liability
that would result from adjusting his 2002 return, but not his 2003 through 2005 returns, the
partner filed suit to challenge the FPAA. Id. at 388. Explaining that “the overarching statutory
requirement is that the total ‘tax liability’ be deposited,” the Court held that the partner was
required to deposit the amount by which the FPAA would increase his tax liability for 2003,
2004, and 2005 as well. Id. at 390; see also Grapevine Imports, Ltd. v. United States, 71 Fed. Cl.
324, 326 (2006) (noting that a petitioning partner’s deposit that included the amount by which an
FPAA issued for 1999 would increase the partner’s tax liability for 1999 and 2000 was “in
accordance with section 6226(e)”).

3

In Kislev, discussed infra, the petitioning partner argued that the use of the singular
“return” in the statute imported that the amount of the deposit was limited to the partner’s
increased tax liability for the year for which the FPAA was issued. Kislev, 84 Fed. Cl. at 389.
As the Court there explained, however, under standard principles of statutory construction, a
legislative term in the singular form may be used to apply to multiple subjects or objects. Id.
(citing Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:34
(7th ed. 2007)); see also 1 U.S.C. § 1 (“In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,
unless the context indicates otherwise, words importing the singular include and apply to several
persons, parties, or things . . . . ). Thus, Congress’s use of singular “return” is insufficient
support for plaintiff’s position.

-12-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 19 of 28

In addition to reading into the statute a limitation not found in its text, plaintiff’s
interpretation would produce the odd result that, in cases such as this, where an FPAA has no
effect on the partner’s tax liability in the year for which it was issued, the petitioning partner
would not have to make any jurisdictional deposit. Such a result is clearly at odds with the
congressional intent that a partner be required to make a deposit before filing a suit for judicial
review of an FPAA in federal court. Indeed, Congress already provided a means for a partner to
challenge an FPAA without making a deposit first – that is, by filing the petition in Tax Court.
As noted above, a partner can file such a suit in either the Tax Court, district court, or the Court
of Federal Claims, whereas making a deposit is a prerequisite to filing in district court or the
Court of Federal Claims only. See § 6226(e)(1). Thus, plaintiff’s interpretation would disturb
the jurisdictional framework established by Congress for suits brought under § 6226.
B.

“Tax Liability,” as Used in Section 6226(e) to Determine the Required Deposit,
Has Been Interpreted in an Analogous Partnership Context to Include a Partner’s
Tax Liability for Years Other than the Year for Which the FPAA Was Issued

The scope of the deposit requirement under § 6226(e)(1) to include the years in which
benefits were claimed is also confirmed by cases that have interpreted similar language in other
TEFRA provisions. In Olson v. United States, 37 Fed. Cl. 727, 732 (1997), aff’d 172 F.3d 1311
(Fed. Cir. 1999), this Court interpreted the definition of “tax liability” in § 6231(a)(6) to
encompass adjustments to all of a partner’s affected tax years as a result of the treatment of a
partnership item under the TEFRA provisions. Section 6231(a)(6), employing language similar
to that of § 6226(e)(1), defines a “computational adjustment” as: “[T]he change in the tax
liability of a partner which properly reflects the treatment under this subchapter of a partnership
item.” (Emphasis added.) Once a final partnership-level adjustment has been made to a

-13-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 20 of 28

partnership item, the IRS may make a computational adjustment to a partner’s tax liability
without first issuing a notice of deficiency, where the determination of the deficiency involved is
“merely computational” and does not require further factual investigation. § 6230(a)(1); Olson,
37 Fed. Cl. at 732, aff’d 172 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
Such computational adjustments may, in turn, affect the amount of other items on an
individual partner’s return, and such items are called “affected items.” § 6231(a)(5). If the
determination of an affected item does not require partner-level factual determinations, the
change in the partner’s tax liability attributable to the change in the affected item may also be
assessed by the IRS by way of computational adjustment without first issuing a notice of
deficiency, regardless of the year in which the tax liability occurs. § 6230(a)(2)(A)(i); Olson, 37
Fed. Cl. at 732.
In Olson, this Court interpreted the TEFRA provisions to permit a computational
adjustment to a partner’s tax liability for tax years other than the partnership’s taxable year that
was the subject of partnership level administrative and judicial proceedings. In Olson, the
proceedings at the partnership level resulted in a disallowance of a credit that was claimed by the
partnership in 1983. Olson, 37 Fed. Cl. at 734. The partner claimed his distributive share of this
credit on his joint individual return filed for 1983, and carried the credit back to 1980, 1981, and
1982, and forward to 1984. Id. The IRS assessed the partner for the carryforward and carryback
years by way of a computational adjustment, which the partner challenged in a partner-level
proceeding, contending that the assessments for those years could not be made without issuing a
notice of deficiency. Id. The Court rejected the partner’s challenge, holding that the IRS could
assess the partner for the carryover and carryback years by way of computational adjustment. Id.

-14-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 21 of 28

at 735. Other courts have reached the same result in similar circumstances. See Cummings v.
Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1996-282, 1996 WL 334418, at *3 (U.S. Tax Ct. 1996) (holding that
net operating loss carryovers to later years are affected items that can be assessed by
computational adjustment); Bob Hamric Chevrolet, Inc. v. United States, 849 F. Supp. 500, 512
(W.D. Tex. 1994) (holding that “[d]etermining the amount of a loss carryover or carryback as a
result of a settlement agreement relating to partnership items requires only a computational
adjustment”).
Therefore, the “tax liability” of a partner includes the tax liability calculated based upon
the adjustments made by the FPAA to partnership level items for all years in which those
partnership items affect the partner’s return, whether it is for purposes of a computational
adjustment made pursuant to § 6231(a)(6), or for purposes of calculating the jurisdictional
deposit of § 6226(e).
C.

Plaintiff’s Interpretation Is Inconsistent with this Court’s Prior Decisions
Interpreting the Statute of Limitations for Assessments Based on FPAA
Adjustments

This Court’s prior decisions regarding the statute of limitations for assessments similarly
demonstrate that the concept of a partner’s tax liability for changes made by an FPAA
encompasses years other than the one for which the FPAA was issued.
In Grapevine Imports, Ltd. v. United States, 71 Fed. Cl. 324 (2006) (hereinafter
“Grapevine I”), and Grapevine Imports, Ltd. v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. 505 (2007)
(hereinafter “Grapevine II”), the IRS issued an FPAA for the partnership’s taxable period
ending December 31, 1999. The adjustments made by the FPAA affected a partner’s individual
liability for his 1999 and 2000 taxable years. Grapevine I, 71 Fed. Cl. at 326. The partner

-15-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 22 of 28

deposited the amount of his increased tax liability for both 1999 and 2000 resulting from the
adjustments made by the 1999 FPAA and then filed a motion for summary judgment, contending
that the statute of limitations had expired with respect to his 1999 and 2000 taxable year with the
result that the 1999 FPAA was untimely. Id. The defendant cross moved, asserting that the
limitations period for both 1999 and 2000 remained open, although for different grounds as to
each year. Id.
In Grapevine I, this Court held that the statute of limitations with respect to the year 2000
was open as to the partner’s individual taxable year, denied the partner’s motion for summary
judgment, and granted the defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment as to that year. Id.
at 344. The Court held open its decision as to the partner’s 1999 taxable year – which was the
year of the partnership for which the FPAA issued – pending further development of the facts.
Id. at 343.
In Grapevine II, the Court of Federal Claims held that the partner’s 1999 year was
closed, so the FPAA was untimely as to that year. Grapevine II, 77 Fed. Cl. at 512. The Court
went on to hold that even though the statute of limitations barred an assessment against the
partner for 1999 – the year in which the losses were claimed by the partnership and disallowed
by the FPAA – the IRS was not barred from adjusting the partner’s liability for 2000 due to the
effect the 1999 disallowed losses had on that year. Id. at 512-13. The rationale for the
Grapevine II Court’s decision was that, while the statute of limitations barred assessments, it did
not bar calculations. Id. (citing Barenholtz v. United States, 784 F.2d 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).

-16-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

Filed 12/04/09 Page 23 of 28

Therefore, the adjustments made by the FPAA for 1999 were to be used to calculate the partner’s
liability for the later year, even though his 1999 year was barred by the statute of limitations.4
Thus, Grapevine I and II demonstrate that a partner’s tax liability for adjustments made
by the IRS to partnership items is not limited to the effects of an FPAA on the year for which it
was issued. If the “tax liability of the partner” were calculated solely with reference to the year
for which the FPAA was issued, as plaintiff advocates, then there would be no reason for
continuing with a case in which the statute of limitations bars an assessment for the year in
which the FPAA was issued. By rejecting that argument in Grapevine II, the Court confirmed
that a partner’s “tax liability” includes his liability for years other than the year for which the
FPAA was issued.
By the same token, a partner’s “tax liability” for purposes of determining the amount of
the jurisdictional deposit must be read to encompass the partner’s tax liability for years other
than the one adjusted by the FPAA. Otherwise, a partner would have standing to bring a suit
under § 6226 in federal court to challenge an FPAA that would solely affect his tax liability for
years other than the year for which the FPAA was issued, without having to make the
jurisdictional deposit envisioned by Congress. Thus, as a corollary to the Court’s Grapevine II
decision, a partner who seeks to challenge an FPAA under § 6226 must deposit the entire amount

4

See also J&J Fernandez Ventures, L.P. v. United States, 84 Fed. Cl. 369, 378 (2007)
(holding that the IRS is not barred from recalculating partnership items from closed years for
purposes of assessing taxes in open years); Kligfeld Holdings v. Commissioner, 128 T.C. 192,
201-02 (2007) (holding that the IRS is not barred from issuing an FPAA for a closed year and
relying on the FPAA adjustments to recompute a partner’s tax liability for an open year).

-17-

Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 49

by which his tax liability – for all affected years – would increase if computed consistently with
the FPAA.5
Accordingly, because Larson has failed to deposit the full $835,687 by which his tax
liability would increase as a result of the FPAA adjustments, the Court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over the complaint.
II.

The Gross Disparity Between the “Deposit” and the Tax Liability Computed with the
Adjustments Made by the FPAA Is Indicative of Bad Faith
Section 6226(e)(1) permits a taxpayer to amend his deposit to cure a shortfall if the Court

determines that the insufficient deposit was nevertheless a good faith effort to satisfy the
jurisdictional requirement. Larson’s deposit is woefully deficient and does not meet the good
faith standard. Larson made a token deposit of only $100, representing a mere .01% of the
required amount of $835,687. He did so knowing that the effect of the FPAA was to disallow
$2.6 million of losses he claimed between 1998 and 2001. And although plaintiff argues that the
jurisdictional deposit need only reflect the increased tax liability for the year in which the FPAA
adjusted the partnership return, Larson also knew that his $100 deposit did not reflect anything.
His deposit was simply a nominal payment, a superficial recognition that there is a requirement
to make a jurisdictional deposit, but not an effort to calculate and satisfy it. Larson’s deposit
therefore falls far short of a good faith estimate of the amount of the tax liability computed by
treating the partnership items consistently with the FPAA.

5

For taxable years for which returns are due after the complaint, there is no return upon
which to calculate the effect of the FPAA adjustments as of the date of the complaint, so
§ 6226(e)(1) does not apply to those years.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, plaintiff’s $100 deposit fails to satisfy the jurisdictional
deposit requirement of § 6226(e)(1), and the complaint should be dismissed for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction.
