PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO RCEC 12(b)(1) AND
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

 

JL Investment Trust ("plaintiff"), a notice partner in Prestop Holdings, LLC,
brought this action under 26 U.S.C. 6226(b) on May 26, 2005 to challenge adjustments to
partnership items made by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in a Notice of Final
Partnership Administrative Adjustment issued on December 27, 2004 (the "FPAA").
Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6226(e)(1), JL Investment Trust was required to deposit with the
Internal Revenue Service (the "Service'") the amount by which the tax liability of the
partner would be increased if the treatment of partnership items on the partner's return
were made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as
adjusted by the FPAA. JL Investment Trust determined that the adjustments proposed by
the FPAA would not affect the treatment of partnership items on its return (or the return

of its grantor, John L. Larson), nor would the adjustments increase its (or Mr. Larson's)
Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 54 Filed 02/04/10 Page 6 of 19

tax liability for the year in question. Accordingly, JL Investment Trust made a nominal
deposit of $100 as a demonstration of good faith (Complaint, Exhibit B).

On December 4, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss this action pursuant
to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging that
the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that Mr. Larson failed to make
the jurisdictional deposit required by 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6226(e)(1). The defendant also claims
that the $100 deposit made by JL Investment Trust was not a good faith effort to satisfy

the jurisdictional deposit requirement of 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6226(e)(1).

QUESTIONS PRESENTED
1. Whether the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
where the plaintiff made a nominal jurisdictional deposit of $100 based on the partner's
lack of any tax liability for the 1997 year if the United States Court of Federal Claims
were to sustain the adjustments made by the Internal Revenue Service in the FPAA dated
December 27, 2004,
2. Whether the plaintiff made a good faith effort to deposit the amount of the partner's
tax liability that would be owed if the Court were to sustain the adjustments made by the
Service in the FPAA dated December 27, 2004.
3. | Whether a shortfall in the jurisdictional deposit is timely corrected if payment is
made within 60 to 90 days after the Court determines that there was a shortfall in the

deposit.

ARGUMENT
1.` Plaintiff has satisfied the jurisdictional deposit requirement of section
6226(e)(1)

The plaintiff has satisfied the jurisdictional deposit requirement of section 6226
(e)(1) in this case. JL Investment Trust (a grantor trust) deposited a nominal amount of
$100 because grantor John L. Larson's tax liability would not be increased in the tax year
before the Court (1997) if the government's position set forth in the FPAA is ultimately
held to be correct. The defendant concedes that the FPAA adjustments to the
partnership's 1997 tax return do not affect Mr. Larson's tax liability for that year
(Defendant's Motion at p. 4.). In its motion to dismiss, the defendant asserts that the
$100 deposit was deficient because it should have included the amounts that Mr. Larson's
tax returns would be increased in subsequent years if this Court ultimately upheld the
adjustments made by the Internal Revenue Service in the FPAA. To get to this result, the
defendant relies on Kislev Partners, L.P. ex rel. Bahar v. United States, 84 Fed. Cl. 385
(2008), reh'g denied, 84 Fed. Cl. 378 (2008), in which this Court held that section
6226(e} requires the petitioning partner to deposit the amount by which the FPAA
adjustments would increase the tax liability for all affected years. Following the filing of
the defendant's motion to dismiss on December 4, 2009, a decision was issued in Russian
Recovery Fund v. United States, (Docket Number 06-30 T, December 14, 2009) in which
this Court followed the rationale set forth in Kislev Partners and also held that the deposit
requirement implicates multiple years of the partner's returns. With all due respect to the
Court, the Kislev Partners and Russian Recovery Fund decisions misinterpret the clear

language of section 6226(e)(1), which states as follows:
Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 54 Filed 02/04/10 Page 8 of 19

A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district
court of the United States or the Claims Court only if the partner
filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the day
the petition is filed, the amount by which the tax liability of the
partner would be increased if the treatment of partnership items on
the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment of
partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the final
partnership administrative adjustment.

26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6226(e)(1) (emphasis added).
Section 6226(e)(1) clearly refers to the taxpayer's return, and the word "return" expressly
refers to a single return rather than multiple "returns." Section 6226(e)(1) does not
address tax liabilities on a number of the taxpayer's returns for a number of years. Yet

that is exactly the way the defendant (and the Kislev Partners and Russian Recovery Fund

 

decisions) reads this clear statutory language. Instead, this section only requires a deposit
of the amount of the increase in the taxpayer's tax liability on the taxpayer's return for
the year of the FPAA that is before the Court.

The statute does not refer to any and all returns affected by the partnership items on
the partnership return as adjusted by the FPAA. The defendant's position that the deposit
should encompass not only the tax increase that would result in the taxpayer's return for
the year before the Court, but all subsequent returns, also conflicts with the
accompanying regulations promulgated by the United States Department of the Treasury:
Amount to be deposited.

(1) In general. -The jurisdictional amount that the filing partner .. .
shall deposit is the amount by which the tax liability of the

partner would be increased if the treatment of the partnership item
on the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment
of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the

Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment.

Treas, Reg. 0x00A7 301.6226(e)-1 (emphasis added).
Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 54 Filed 02/04/10 Page 9 of 19

Our interpretation that only the return for the year before the Court should be considered
in calculating the deposit is further strengthened by an example in this regulation:

A files a petition for readjustment of partnership items in the

United States Court of Federal Claims. A's tax liability would be

increased by $4,000 if partnership items on A's return were

conformed to the partnership return, as adjusted by the Notice of

Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment.

Treas. Reg. 0x00A7 301.6226(e)-1(2) (emphasis added).
Thus, the defendant's regulations do not permit or support the defendant's interpretation
that the statutory language covers all of the partner's returns in which the partnership
items were used.

According to the Court in the Kislev Partners decision, the "overarching statutory
requirement [of section 6226] is that the total `tax liability' be deposited as a
jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining suit in this forum." In Russian Recovery Fund,
the Court agreed with Kisiev Partners in holding that the "total tax liability deposit
requirement trumps the singular `return' [language in the statute]." The Court in both
cases continues to misinterpret the statute and invent additional statutory language to
support the decisions. The statute does not reference "total" tax liability; it merely
references the partner's "tax liability." By adding the word "total" to the statutory
language, the Court finds legitimacy for its position that the deposit must be calculated
based on multiple years and multiple tax returns. A "total" tax liability certainly assumes
adding multiple liabilities from multiple returns. The problem, however, is the word
"total" is not found in the statute. The Court's interpretation that the basic statutory

premise of section 6226 requires full deposit of the total tax liability finds no support in

the clear language of the statute.
Case 1:05-cv-00576-FMA Document 54_ Filed 02/04/10 Page 10 of 19

The Court in Russian Recovery Fund further opines that a voluntary election to
defer losses to subsequent years should not control the deposit amount. According to the
Court, "[a]llowing an entity to do so would permit it to assure itself of a deposit-free
chance to litigate by allocating the loss entirely to other years." Although the Court
seems concerned about possible manipulation, the statutory section as written provides
for a wide range of potential deposit requirements. There should be no dispute that the
statute does not require full deposit of all tax liabilities at issue for all partners potentially
affected by the FPAA; the statute only requires a deposit by the partner bringing suit.
Assuming a tax matters partner or notice partner with a small minority partnership
interest, that partner may bring suit with a minimal jurisdictional deposit (even when the
total tax liability for all years is totaled) under section 6226 to challenge an FPAA and
litigate issues with significant financial consequences to multiple other (majority)
partners. The statute, therefore, contemplates a relatively minimal deposit to confer
jurisdiction, despite the interpretation by the Court in Kislev Partners and Russian
Recovery Fund that the total tax liability must be deposited.

The defendant's argument, and corresponding interpretation of section 6226 (e)(1),
run contrary to the long standing rule of statutory interpretation that the plain meaning of
the statute controls. The first "fundamental canon of statutory construction" is that,
"unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,

contemporary and common meaning." National Data Corp. v. United States, 50 Fed. Cl.

 

24 (2001) (citing Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979). The legislative intent
of Congress is to be derived from the language and structure of the statute itself, if

possible. United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259 (1997). Therefore, "statutory
