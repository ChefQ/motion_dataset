Civil No. 2:11-cv-00170-TS
Judge Ted Stewart

The Toones Have Filed a First Amended Complaint. In reviewing the Motion
to Dismiss filed by Defendants Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”), LaSalle Bank, N.A.,
Bank of American, N.A. and Norwest Mortgage, Inc. (collectively “Wells Fargo Defendants”),
the Toones decided :
(a) that they would not pursue the declaratory relief in paragraph 50, subparagraphs (a) (g) – and make it clear that they are not trying to have the Toone Note and Trust Deed declared
null and void;

1

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 2 of 11

(b) that they should make it clear that their “Hamp” related claims are part of the breach
of contract and representation claim for relief,
( c) that they should make their challenge to the validity of the actions of LaSalle/ BOA
and eTtitlle more clear, and
(d) that they should add claims and parties arising from actions taken after the original
complaint herein was filed.
In order to accomplish this, the Toones have filed a First Amended Complaint herein.
The Wells Fargo Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss – as applied to the First Amended
Complaint – should be denied because:
A.

The gravamen of this complaint is the allegation that the purported endorsements on the
Toone Note are defective for many reasons, such that neither LaSalle nor BOA ever
legally became the owner/ endorsee of the Toone Note. If that is true – which for the
purposes of this Motion to Dismiss must be deemed to be true – then eTitle was not
properly and validly appointed Substitute Trustee. If eTitle never legally became the
Substitute Trustee under the Toone Trust Deed, then the commencement of the
foreclosure, the motion to lift stay, the purported foreclosure and then the eviction action
were and are all wrongful and null and void.

B.

The Toones are not going to pursue any exotic claim that the note and trust deed became
separated, that the original note has to be found, or that their note and trust deed should
be extinguished. The relief sought by the Toones herein will not preclude the true owner
of the Toone Note from stepping forward in the future through properly authorized
representatives and pursuing a properly authorized foreclosure.
2

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 3 of 11

C.

The facts alleged in the Complaint and now First Amended Complaint must be deemed to
be true, and they fully support the claims for relief as now set forth in the First Amended
Complaint.

D.

With respect to the Toones’ request for Declaratory Relief, the Wells Fargo Defendants’
Motion to Dismiss addressed only the old paragraphs 50 (a) - (g) – which have all been
eliminated in the First Amended Complaint. Although the Wells Fargo Defendants
asked the Court to dismiss all of the declaratory relief paragraphs, the Motion failed to
articulate any reason why old paragraphs 50(h) - (w) were improper. Because the Court
has been given no reason why any of this remaining declaratory relief is improper, the
motion must fail with respect to the relief sought in the new paragraph 50.

E.

If the allegations of the Complaint and now First Amended Complaint are deemed to be
true, then the defendants did commit fraud on the Bankruptcy Court. The Toones are not
asking this Court to set aside the lift stay order. Rather, they are asking for damages
under the FDCPA and/or the UCSPA arising from this illegal and unlawful debt
collection activity. Wells Fargo’s argument entirely misses the boat in this regard.

F.

If the allegations of the Complaint and now First Amended Complaint are deemed to be
true, then eTitle was not legally and effectively appointed Substitute Trustee under the
Toone Trust Deed. Wells Fargo again mischaracterizes the Toones’ claims. eTitle was
not improperly appointed Substitute Trustee “because the loan had been securitized.”
That is not the Toones’ argument at all. See A above.

G.

Because every one of the endorsements on the Toone Note was defective, only Premier is
exempt from the provisions of the FDCPA. Accubanc, Norwest, LaSalle and BOA never
3

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 4 of 11

acquired the Note when it was not in default – because given the deemed admitted
allegations of the Complaint and now First Amended Complaint, they never legally
acquired it at all. These entities are not protected by the exemption. They are all debt
collectors under the FDCPA.
This includes Wells Fargo. A servicer for the original creditor and for a
subsequent owner of the debt who acquired the debt when it was not in default, is
exempt. However, when Wells Fargo performed servicing for Accubanc, Norwest,
LaSalle and BOA – it was no longer exempt because they had not in fact acquired any
interest in the Toone Note.

Wells Fargo lost its exemption when the endorsements

were not properly done and were illegal, invalid and void.
The FDCPA prohibits (a) any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass,
oppress or abuse any person (15 USC 1692d), (b) the use of any other false, deceptive, or
misleading representation (other than those listed in 1692d) or means in connection with debt
collection (15 USC 1692e), ( c) making any false representation or use of any deceptive means to
collect a debt (15 USC 1692e(10), utilizing any unfair or unconscionable means to collect or
attempt to collect the alleged debt (15 USC 1692f) and the like.
The complaint alleges that the Toones were not in default on their loan but were and had
been making reduced payments pursuant to an express agreement/ loan modification. And then
the defendants wrongfully commenced foreclosure proceedings, forced the Toones into
bankruptcy, did not tell the truth to the bankruptcy court and obtained a lift stay order, and then
proceeded to foreclose on the Toones. This course of events is chock full of shocking and
outrageous violations of the FDCPA. None of the defendants are immune therefrom.

H.

All defendants are subject to the UCSPA because (a) the loan to purchase a home for the
Toones was indisputably a consumer transaction, and (b) they are all suppliers in that they
engage in the “enforcement” of a consumer transaction.
The Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act applies to "consumer transactions," (UCA

13-11-3), and a loan to a consumer is clearly a transaction. The lending of money to a consumer
for consumer purposes is the "sale ... or disposition of goods, services, or other property" – the
money given to the consumer in exchange for a note. Numerous cases in other jurisdictions have
so held. See Lavinia v. Hoard Bank, Clearinghouse No. 26,015 (Vt. Super. Ct. 1976)("Service
means to furnish and supply something needed or desired .... Thus anyone supplying money, a
need, would be one who serves"); Stafford v. Cross Country Bank, 262 F. Supp. 2d 776 (W.D.
Ky. 2003)(Credit is a Service); Flores v. Shapiro & Kreisman, 246 F. Supp. 2d 427 (E.D. Pa.
2002)(UDAP covers loans that finance goods or services for personal use)
The UCSPA defines suppliers as "a seller, lessor, assignor, offeror, broker, or other
person who regularly solicits, engages in, or enforces consumer transactions, whether or not he
deals directly with the consumer." (emphasis added)
Persons who collect consumer debt after the “initial loan transaction” are most certainly
suppliers under the UCSPA.

I.

Wells Fargo again mischaracterizes the Toones’ breach of contract claim. The Toones do
not think it was a breach of contract to sell the note and securitize it. Rather, the Toones
allege that it was a breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing to
agree to give the Toones a hamp modification, accept their modified payments, cause
5

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 6 of 11

them to believe that this was acceptable and would be fine, but at essentially the same
time declare that the Toones were in default and had made no payments on the Note, and
to commence and proceed to foreclose on their home, etc:
In this regard, the First Amended Complaint states as follows:
“16.

In the Spring of 2010, the Toones applied for and began a temporary loan modification

under HAMPS.
17.

The Toones made all of the payments in a lower amount as agreed as per the Hamps

temporary modification.
18.

Wells Fargo, however, failed to credit the Toones with these payments and began sending

notices that the Toones were in default. This violated the terms of the parties' agreement as
modified via the Hamps Temporary Modification and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
Given the representations, warranties and promises made to the Toones which induced them to
enter into the Hamps Temporary Modification (i.e., that it would be acceptable to the Lender for
the Toones to make the lower payments and have the foregone payment amounts added to the
end of the loan, and the like, and that the Toones would remain in good standing under their
loan) and pursuant to which the Toones began to make the lower "modified" payments as agreed,
Wells Fargo, LaSalle and/or BOA were estopped from claiming a default under the Note and
Trust Deed and from later pursuing a lift stay motion and proceeding to foreclose.
25.

In any event, even though the Toones were not in fact in default on the Toones' Note and

Trust Deed, Wells Fargo, BOA and eTitle falsely asserted that the Toones were in default and
purported to commence foreclosure proceedings against the Toones' Residence. This caused the
Toones to suffer extreme fear and emotional distress, as well as damaging their credit.
6

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 7 of 11

26.

Wells Fargo wrongfully refused to finalize a loan modification under the HAMP program

with the Toones, even though the Toones by all indications qualified for a permanent
modification. This violated the promises, warranties and representations that were made to the
Toones at the commencement of the modification process with respect to (a) the standards for
qualifying for a modification, (b) the fact that if the Toones made their payments under the
temporary, trial modification, the modification would be made permanent, and ( c) the other
terms and conditions contained in the Wells Fargo modfiication program descriptions (both
written and on the web). The Toones suffered damage to their credit, were forced to take out
bankruptcy, and are facing the loss of their home and the like.
27.

Because of the illegitimate and wrongful threatened loan foreclosure proceedings, the

Toones filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
73.

The actions of Premier, Accubanc, Norwest, LaSalle and BOA as alleged herein

constitute a breach of contract and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”

J.

The Toones allege that Wells Fargo knowingly and intentionally failed to acknowledge
and respond to the Toones’ QWRs as required by the RESPA. The Toones allege that
this is part of Wells Fargo’s pattern and practice of violating RESPA with respect to
consumer’s QWRs. The Toones outline the manner in which they have been damaged in
their First Amended Complaint. This claim for relief is properly pleaded. Wells Fargo
argues that the QWRs were not proper QWRs under the statute – but without any
foundation and contrary to the allegations of the complaint – which must be deemed to be
true.7

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 8 of 11

The relevant paragraphs for the First Amended Complaint in this regard are:
19.

The Toones wrote and telephoned Wells Fargo numerous numerous times complaining of

these inaccuracies and problems and asking that their accounting be cleaned up. All such written
requests were Qualified Written Requests under RESPA and also requests for validation under
the FDCPA. They also put Wells Fargo, LaSalle and BOA on notice that their actions were
violating the terms of the loan – as "modified" – and that they were estopped from declaring a
default under the circumstances.
20.

Wells Fargo, LaSalle and/or BOA did not properly respond to these QWRs as required by

RESPA, did not stop declaring a default even though the Toones were making their modified
payments as had been expressly agreed, and failed to correct the accounting which Wells Fargo
claimed showed that payments were not properly being made and that the loan was in default.
These actions not only violated RESPA, but also were breaches of the parties' agreements, and
violations of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This caused the Toones immense fear
and emotional distress and ultimately drove them into bankrupty and a total loss of the semblance
of good credit that they otherwise would have had.
35.

The Toones sent numerous additional Qualified Written Requests (QWRs) under

RESPA to Wells Fargo complaining about the incorrect accounting, demanding identification of
the true owner of their Note and Trust Deed, and the like and a retraction of the foreclosure
proceedings.
42. Wells Fargo failed to properly respond to any of the Toones' QWRs as required by RESPA,
either with respect to timeliness or substantively. The nature and extent of these violations, plus
the manner in which they have failed to properly respond to QWRs from other borrowers,
8

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 9 of 11

demonstrate that Wells Fargo's RESPA violations are knowing and wilful and that Wells Fargo
has a pattern and practice of knowingly and wilfully violating RESPA with respect to QWRs.
43.

Under RESPA, if a servicer of a loan – which Wells Fargo is – has received a QWR from

a borrower, the servicer can not proceed to collect payments on or otherwise seek to enforce the
terms of the loan unless or until the servicer has fully and properly complied with its RESPA
obligations with respect to each QWR.
44.

Despite having failed to properly address these QWRs, Wells Fargo has allowed eTitle

and Lundberg Associates to proceed with foreclosure activities and have continued to make
negative credit reporting about the Toones to various Credit Reporting Agencies. eTitle
purported to foreclose on the Toones' residence on January 3, 2011. Lundberg, Gunnerson,
DeHann and Brigham Lundberg served the Toones with 5-day Notices to Vacate on or about
January 19, 2011, even though they knew from the institution of this action, that it was almost
certain that the purported foreclosure was void. Lundberg, Gunnerson, DeHann and Brigham
Lundberg then filed an unlawful detainer/ eviction lawsuit against the Toones.
76.

Wells Fargo violated RESPA as outlined herein. Those violations were knowing and

wilful and part of a pattern and practice of knowing and wilful RESPA violations by Wells
Fargo. The Toones have suffered damages as a result in that (a) they were unable to get Wells
Fargo to realize and admit that the Toones had not failed to make payments as agreed – given the
fact that there was a trial modification in place, (b) the foreclosure proceeded unabated and
wrongfully, ( c) they were forced to try to obtain some protection through a bankruptcy – which
took a great deal of time and involved costs and fees, (d) they suffered severe credit damage, (e)
they were subjected to a fraudulent lift stay motion, (f) the foreclosure sale proceeded even
9

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 10 of 11

though the statute barred Wells Fargo from taking any steps to collect the debt while any QWR
remained outstanding and unresponded to, (g) the Toones experienced extreme frustration,
anxiety, fear and emotional distress and (h) the Toones have been forced to incur legal costs and
attorneys fees.
77.

In addition to the declaratory relief requested above, the Toones are entitled to an award

of actual and full RESPA statutory damages per violation, costs and attorneys fees.
The QWRs described herein clearly related to servicing. The elements of a claim for
violation of RESPA are clearly all included and properly pleaded.

.

CONCLUSION
The Toones have deleted from their First Amended Complaint the declaratory relief about
which the Wells Fargo Defendants complained. The remaining declaratory relief is proper and
fully supported by the deemed admitted allegations of the First Amended Complaint.
In every other regard, the Motion to Dismiss is simply misplaced and unpersuasive and
should be denied.
The Toones have raised serious, substantive challenges to the right of these entities to
have done any of the acts which they committed with respect to the Toones’ residence. The
Toones have set forth detailed factual bases for their claims. The Toones have articulated the
10

Case 2:11-cv-00170-TS Document 22 Filed 04/15/11 Page 11 of 11

elements of the various claims for relief. The motion to dismiss should be denied.
DATED this 15th day of April, 2011.
