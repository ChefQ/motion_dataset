IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

 

MARLAYNA G. TILLMAN,
C.A. Number: 04-1314
Plaintiff,
v.

THE PEPSI BOTTLING GROUP, INC.,
and TEAMSTERS LOCAL UNION 830,

Defendanis.

 

OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANT BOTTLING GROUP, LLC
TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO QUASH

This is an employment case in which Plaintiff, a former employee of the Pepsi
Bottling Group, Inc. ("PBG"), alleges discrimination, retaliation and violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. PBG asserts counterclaims for fraud and unjust enrichment against Plaintiff
stemming from her unlawful receipt of worker's compensation benefits.

In June 2004, the Law Offices of Beverly Bove, Esquire, represented Plaintiff in a
worker's compensation action brought against PRG. That claim was settled when Plaintiff
entered into an agreement with PBG under which she received monetary compensation. The
settlement agreement resolved Plaintiff's claim of "total disability" for the time period of
November 6, 2003 through April 18, 2004. (See Letter to Erik C. Grandell, Esquire with
enclosures, attached as Exhibit A.) However, during this period, when Plaintiff was asserting to
PBG that she had a "total disability" and was unable to work because of medical Teasous,
Plaintiff applied for and accepted employment with RIM Vending Company ("RJM"). (See

Documentation of Employment at RIM Vending Company, attached as Exhibit B.)

DMEAST #9668739 v1
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document77 ~ Filed 11/17/2006 Page2of6

At her deposition in the instant action, Plaintiff was asked about the settlement of
her worker's compensation claim and her work at RJM during the same time period. Plaintiff
maintained that, although she received compensation from PBG in 2004, she had no knowledge
that her worker's compensation claim had been settled, as her attorney neither showed her the
settlement agreement nor explained to her its terms. (See Tillman Dep. at 89-98, attached as
Exhibit C.) In addition, Plaintiff asserted that she never received the settlement check made out
to her from Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., PBG's worker's compensation
insurance carrier, nor did she recall ever giving her attorney permission to sign the check on her
behalf. (id.) In short, Plaintiff asserted as a defense to PBG's claims for fraud and unjust
enrichment that she was not aware that her receipt of worker's compensation benefits was based
on an assertion that she was totally disabled from November 6, 2003 through April 18, 2004.

It is well established that a party can waive the attorney client privilege by
asserting claims or defenses that put her attorney's advice at issue in the litigation. See
Livingstone v. North Belle Vernon Borough, 91 F.3d 515, 537 (3d. Cir. 1996) (citing Rhone-
Poulenc Rorer Inc. v. Home Indem. Co., 32 F.3d 851, 863 (3d Cir. 1994)). By placing her
attorney's advice, or lack thereof, at issue in this litigation, Plaintiff has waived the attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communications with her worker's compensation attorney
about the settlement of her worker's compensation claim. Case law in this circuit directly
supports this conclusion. See, Livingstone, 91 F.3d at 537 (holding that plaintiff's "assertion that
she did not appreciate the release-dismissal agreement's legal implications is tantamount to a
claim that her attorney did not give her accurate legal advice" thus "[i]t would be unfair to allow
[plaintiff] to make this claim without permitting the opposing parties to investigate her attorney's

version of the relevant events."); Synalloy Corp. v. Gray, 142 F.R.D. 266, 270 (D. Del. 1993)

DMEAST #9665739 v1 3
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document77 ~ Filed 11/17/2006 Page 3of6

("Because [the defendant] raised the issues of its lack of understanding of the Agreement and
fraudulent misrepresentation, in circumstances in which perhaps the only people who would
have explained the agreement to it were its attorneys, the [defendant's] assertion in the
counterclaim was an implicit waiver of the privilege."),

PBG hereby respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiff's motion to quash.
PBG addresses each of Plaintiff's averments as follows:

1. Admitted. (A copy of the subpoena and cover letter served on Beverly
Bove, Esquire is attached as Exhibit D.)

2, Admitted.

3. Denied. Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, the settlement of Plaintiff's
worker's compensation claim against PBG is highly relevant to the instant action. As set forth
above, Plaintiff's worker's compensation settlement resolved her claim of "total disability" for
the time period of November 6, 2003 through April 18, 2004. Despite her claim to PBG that she
was totally disabled and unable to work because of medical reasons during this time period,
Plaintiff applied for and accepted employment with RIM Vending Company. (See Exhibits A
and B.) When asked at her deposition about the settlement of her worker's compensation claim,
Plaintiff asserted that, although she received compensation from PBG in 2004, she had no
knowledge that her claim had been settled, as her attorney neither showed her the settlement
agreement nor explained to her its terms. (See Exhibit C.) Additionally, Plaintiff claimed that
she never received the settlement check made out to her from Sedgwick Claims Management
Services, Inc., and did not recall giving her attorney permission to sign the check on he behalf.

(See Exhibit. C.) By placing her attorney's conduct at issue in this litigation, Plaintiff has

DMEAST #9665739 v1 4
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document77 Filed 11/17/2006 Page4of6

waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to any communications with her attorney about
the settlement of her worker's compensation claim.

4. Denied. See Paragraph 3 above.

5, Denied. By placing her attorney's advice, or lack thereof, at issue in this
litigation, Plaintiff has waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to any communications
with her attorney about the settlement of her worker's compensation claim. As such, this
information is not subject to the attorney-client privilege.

6. Denied. See Paragraphs 3 and 5 above.

7. Denied. PBG's subpoena to Ms. Bove does not demand disclosure of
"mental impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories." To the contrary, PBG seeks
information including but not limited to: (1) any executed settlement agreements evidencing the
settlement of Plaintiffs worker's compensation claim; (2) any notes regarding conversations
about the settlement; and (3) any letters sent to Plaintiff regarding, enclosing or communicating
the terms of the settlement agreement and/or settlement agreements. (See Exhibit C.) Such
information is directly relevant to Plaintiff's defense to PBG's fraud and unjust enrichment
counterclaims.

8. Admitted, However, Plaintiff's contention that she is not seeking
duplicative damages misses the mark. The requested information is relevant to PBG's
counterclaims of fraud and unjust enrichment against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's defense that she has
no knowledge about the settlement of her worker's compensation claim.

9, Denied. See Paragraphs 3 and 5.

10. Denied. See Exhibit C.

11, Denied. See Exhibit C.

DMEAST #9665739 v1 5
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document77 Filed 11/17/2006 Page5of6

12. Denied as stated. While PBG's counterclaim against Plaintiff does not
attach the issue of Plaintiff's attorney-client relationship with her worker's compensation
attorney, Plaintiff's own statements at her deposition placed her attorney's advice at issue in this
litigation.

13. Denied. See Paragraphs 3 and 5. In addition, pursuant to Rule 1.6(b)(5)
of the Delaware Rules of Professional conduct, an attorney may reveal information relating to
the representation of a client "to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's
representation of the client."(emphasis added), Thus, Ms. Bove clearly has the right and the
obligation to produce the requested information.

14. Denied. See Paragraphs 3, 5 and 13.

15. Denied. See Paragraphs 3 and 5.

16. Denied. See Paragraphs 3, 5 and 13.

17. Denied. See Paragraphs 3, 5 and 13.

18. Admitted.

19, Denied.
