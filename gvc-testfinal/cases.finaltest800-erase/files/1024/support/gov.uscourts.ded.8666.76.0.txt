PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA
DIRECTED TO BEVERLY BOVE, ESQUIRE

Plaintiff, Marlayna G. Tillman, through counsel, hereby moves this court pursuant to
Rule 45(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for an order, quashing the subpoena of
defendant, The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. directed to Beverly Bove, Esquire, and states the
following in support thereof:

1, On October 31, 2006, defendant, The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. served upon Beverly
Bove, Esquire, Tillman's prior worker's compensation attorney in a Delaware claim, its

subpoena for production of:

"[alny executed settlement agreement evidencing the settlement of
Ms. Tillman's worker's compensation claim. Any notes regarding
conversations about the settlement. Any letters sent to Ms. Tillman
regarding, enclosing or communicating the terms of the settlement
agreement and/or settlement agreements."

2. The subpoena bears a return date of November 14, 2006. A true and correct copy of

the subpoena is attached hereto, made a part hereof and marked exhibit "A".
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document 76 Filed 11/14/2006 Page 2of8&

3. Ms. Tillman's Delaware worker's compensation claim, formerly handled by Beverly
Bove, Esquire, has no relevance to this action and defendant, Pepsi could never meet its required
showing to demonstrate or explain how or why any factual or legal issue in the compensation
claim, would bear on any factual or legal issue in this action.

4. Defendant, Pepsi could never meet its required showing to demonstrate or explain how
or why any documents that might exist in the compensation claim, would reasonably lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence in this action. F.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).

5. Under the Federal Rules, defendant, Pepsi improperly seeks production of documents
and materials in this action that are expressly privileged under an attorney-client relationship
between Tillman and prior counsel in a completely unrelated claim, and therefore protected from
discovery without exception. F.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).

6. Because none of the subpoenaed material is discoverable under subpart (b)(1) of Rule
26, whether Pepsi can make a showing that it has any need for the materials in preparation of a
defense, or that it could not without undue hardship obtain the substantial equivalent of the
materials by other means, is equally irrelevant to any inquiry on enforcement of the subpoena.
F.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).

7. Assuming arguendo, even if defendant, Pepsi could demonstrate a need for any of the
material under subpoena, Pepsi's subpoena is overly broad and violates the Federal Rules, in that
it improperly demands disclosure of mental impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories
of Tillman's personal attorney during the same period Tillman's cause of action against Pepsi
(and the Union) was accruing in this action. F.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).

8. Tillman's action against Pepsi is not a worker's compensation claim, and Tillman does

bo
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document 76 Filed 11/14/2006 Page 3of8&

not (nor could she by law) seek a damage in this action duplicative of any damage she might
have recovered in the worker's compensation claim nor could Pepsi make any showing that she
is making such a duplicative claim.

9. The subpoena is a putative direct attempt by defendant, Pepsi to obtain from a non-
party in an unrelated claim, factual discovery of Tillman beyond the scope and limits of
allowable discovery in this action under the Federal Rules. F.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).

10. Tillman has not waived in this action her right to invoke the attorney-client
relationship or privilege between herself and her worker's compensation attorney in that claim,
by any act, statement, conduct, document or pleading of Tillman in this action.

11, Tillman has not raised in this action any issue or claim that would involve or invoke
the attorney-client relationship between herself and her worker's compensation attorney in the
compensation claim.

12. Defendant, Pepsi's counterclaim against Tillman does not attach the issue of
Tillman's attorney-client relationship with her worker's compensation attorney, or need for
documents or materials based on a putative claim of a waiver, and Pepsi can show none.

13. Because Tillman has not authorized the production of any document referenced or
demanded under the subpoena or waived her privilege, the party to whom the subpoena is
directed has no obligation or right to produce such documents or materials to defendant, Pepsi
through this subpoena, and Rule 45 protections apply.

14, The Federal Rules permit this court to quash or modify the subpoena if it requires

disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception applies. F.R.Civ.P.

45(c)(3)(A)(iii).
Case 1:04-cv-01314-SLR Document 76 Filed 11/14/2006 Page4of8&

15. Defendant, Pepsi has no right and can make no showing of a need to inspect or copy
Tillman's attorney's files and documents in an unrelated legal claim.

16. The subpoena on its face is unlawful in its scope and amounts to nothing more than
an improper fishing expedition, and the subpoena should be quashed.

17. Tillman's claim of privilege under the attorney-client relationship, asserted in this
motion, satisfies the requirements of subpart (d)(2) of Rule 45, in that all of the documents and
materials commanded under the subpoena are protected under the privilege, enabling Pepsi to
contest the claim.

18. This motion to quash is timely under Rule 45.

19. Good cause exists to quash the subpoena directed to Beverly Bove, Esquire.

WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, plaintiff requests that the attached order,
quashing the subpoena directed to Beverly Bove, Esquire be entered.
