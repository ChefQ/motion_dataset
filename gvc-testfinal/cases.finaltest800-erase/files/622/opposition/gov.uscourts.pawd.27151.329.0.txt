GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSTION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)
AND NOW comes the United States of America, by its attorneys, David J. Hickton,
United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and Troy Rivetti and Cindy
Chung, Assistant United States Attorneys for said district, and respectfully files this response in
opposition to the defendant’s motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
3582(c)(2). Doc. No. 326.
The government has reviewed the procedural history of the defendant’s case and opposes
the defendant’s motion for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to the United States
Sentencing Guidelines and Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).
“A reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized ... if ... (B) an
amendment listed in subsection (d) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s
applicable guideline range.” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a)(2) (Nov. 1, 2014). Amendment 782 did not
provide a two-level reduction for offense levels based upon quantities of cocaine over 450
kilograms; rather, the base offense level in such circumstances remains at 38. See U.S.S.G. §
2D1.1(c) (Nov. 1, 2014). Therefore, defendants whose offense levels were determined pursuant
to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, based upon a cocaine quantity greater than 450 kilograms, receive no
benefit pursuant to Amendment 782. U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(a)(2)(A).

Case 2:04-cr-00109-AJS Document 329 Filed 04/10/15 Page 2 of 2

The defendant is ineligible for a reduction because his offense level was determined
based upon a cocaine quantity of 2500 kilograms pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1. See Addendum
to Presentence Investigation Report at 2; Court Slip at 2; Statement of Reasons at 1 (indicating a
total offense level of 43, calculated using a base offense level of 38). Under Amendment 782,
the base offense level for a quantity of 2500 kilograms cocaine remains at 38. U.S.S.G. §
2D1.1(c) (Nov. 1, 2014). Because the defendant’s original guideline range has not been reduced,
the defendant is not entitled to any reduction. U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(a)(2)(A).
Wherefore, the government respectfully submits its response in opposition to the
defendant’s motion for a reduced sentence.
Respectfully submitted,
