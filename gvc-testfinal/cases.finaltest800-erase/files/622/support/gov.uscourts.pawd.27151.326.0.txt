MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. 0x00A73582(c) (2) (2014)
DRUGS MINUS 2 (AMENDMENT 782) APPLIED RETROACTIVELY

Petitioner comes before this court seeking the reduction of
his prison sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 0x00A73582(c)(2)(2014). He
asks that this Court give retroactive effect to Amendment 782
under U.S.S.G. 0x00A71Bl1.10 and reduce his sentence from Life to
months (as the Court deems fit). The Sentencing Commission has
expressly designated Amendment 782 as one that may be applied
retroactively. U.S.S.G. 0x00A71B1.10(c) p-s. (2014).

The District Court makes two determinations in deciding to
modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. 0x00A73582(c)(2). Under the 18t step;
the sentencing court considers what sentence it would have imposed
had the retroactive amendment been in effect at the time the defendant

was sentenced. U.S.S.G. 0x00A71B1.10(b), ps 2014.

 

JUDICIAL NOTICE TO BE TAKEN

The jury verdict reflects the defendant's guilt in a drug

offense involving five (5) kilograms or more of cocaine, under

21 U.S.C. 0x00A7841(b)(1) (A). The jury verdict only supports a base
offense level of 32 based on a finding of guilt for an offense
involving five (5). kilograms of cocaine, under 0x00A72D1.1(c)(4). Plus
a verdict of guilty under 0x00A71956 a two (2) points enhancement a
base total level of 34 - I. Now Amendment 782 change in drug
quantity determines a level 32 - I a sentence of less than life.

(Plus the Court's appointed enhancement if still applicable?)

`The Judge found facts in this case determined a base offense

 

 
 

level of 43 and criminal history level of _1 (No past criminal
history). Now even without regards to the statements under Judicial
Notice the base offense level would be 41 and the criminal history
points of 0 would not change. The sentencing range would be

324 - 405 under the guideline range.

Under the second step: The District Court having established
the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. 0x00A73553(a) and its thus informed
discretion decide whether to modify the original sentence imposed.
see 18 U.S.C. 0x00A73582(c)(2)(2014). Put more succinctly, the statute
requires the sentence imposed to be minimally sufficient to satisfy
concerns of retribution, general deterrence, specific deterrence,
and rehabilitation.

In conclusion, The Court grants: appointment of the Federal
Defender Program; a supplemental PSR by the P.O.'s Office; and
allows any and all objections from the Government, [or] alternately
in the use of comity the Court re-sentence to _ (as the Court

deems fit).
