I. INTRODUCTION
Six days before the discovery cut-off, fifteen days before the expert witness disclosure

deadline, and less than two months before the expedited trial date, defendant Professional

Basketball Club LLC ("PBC") requests leave to amend its Answer and assert a counterclaim

that would dramatically expand the scope of this litigation. PBC requested and received an
expedited trial date based on its repeated representations that the only issue to be tried was the
City's claim for specific performance. Now, PBC asks this Court to also decide the issue of
damages.

PBC's motion to amend is not the ministerial request PBC makes it out to be. The
issue this Court may need to consider in resolving the City's equitable claim - whether
damages can be calculated with reasonable certainty - is very different from what PBC is now
requesting from this Court - a definitive declaration of the amount of damages to be paid to
the City. To litigate the latter issue fully and fairly, the City would need to conduct
additional, and broader, discovery and investigation, hire additional expert witnesses, and
prepare for an entirely different kind of trial, The expedited trial date was premised on both
parties' representations that there would be only one issue before the court: specific
performance. PBC's attempt to expand the scope of trial at this late date would prejudice the
City and should be denied for that reason alone.

Further, the City 1s entitled to a jury trial on any award of damages for PBC's breach
of the KeyArena lease. The City has preserved its right to a jury trial on any issue properly
tried to a jury, including the issue of damages. Thus, the Court could not grant the relief that
PBC requests ~ a determination of damages by the Court, not a jury - under any
circumstances.

The City respectfully requests that this Court deny PBC's motion for leave to amend.
Alternatively, if the Court grants PBC's motion to amend, the City respectfully requests that
trial of the City's claim and PBC's counterclaim be postponed for at least six months. If PBC
had asserted its counterclaim at the beginning of this case, the City would likely have been
granted at least that extra time to prepare for, and try to a jury, a multi-million dollar damages
claim.

i. STATEMENT OF FACTS
From the beginning of the litigation in this Court (and even in its arbitration demand),

PBC repeatedly represented that the only issue for trial is the City's claim for specific

performance: "[The City: T]he case presents a single issue - whether the City is entitled to
specific performance under the Lease ... [The PBC:] The PBC agrees." Joint Status Report,
p. 9 (Declaration of Jonathan H. Harrison in Support of City of Seattle's Opposition to
Defendant's Motion to Amend Answer ("Harrison Decl."), Ex. 1). PBC attorney Brad Keller
represented that there was only a single, equitable claim at issue:

The single issue that this case presents is whether the City, the
landlord of Key Arena, is entitled to specific performance of the last two
seasons under the lease, specific performance that would require the Sonics to
play out their home games at Key Arena, or whether a court, sitting in equity,
as your Honor will be doing, deciding a specific performance claim, whether
the Court would deny specific performance under these circumstances and
limit the City to its contractual right to be paid the rent.

Transcript of January 29, 2008 Scheduling Conference, p. 6 (Harrison Decl., Ex. 2). Mr.
Keller, for PBC, also represented that only limited discovery was necessary because the only
claim at issue was the City's specific performance claim:

But whether this case is a three day or a four-day trial, or a six or a
seven-day bench trial, the number of witnesses really is modest and the issues
are not complex. This case has been pending for over three and a half months,
since early October. There really isn't a whole lot of discovery to do. Maybe a
half'a dozen or so fact witnesses and some experts and the case is ready.

Id. at 9. Contrary to its prior representations, PBC now asks this Court to decide in the June
trial a different, non-equitable issue: to what determinative amount of damages would the
City be entitled if PBC breaches the KeyArena Lease?

The City has prepared for trial of the equitable issue of whether damages can be
measured with reasonable certainty. It has not attempted to establish, or conduct the
discovery necessary to establish, what any determinative amount of damages would be.
Indeed, the difficulty of determining the exact amount of damages is one of the reasons the

City seeks specific performance.

The City has an expert economist who is prepared to testify about the various models
that exist to measure non-economic damages, and who will further testify about how hard it is
to quantify non-economic damages. The City has not asked its expert, or anyone, to quantify
these damages, because there has not been enough time, and ~ by explicit agreement of the
parties - this has not been part of the trial for which the City has been preparing on an
expedited schedule. Additionally, undertaking a more detailed analysis would be extremely
expensive, and completely unnecessary, if the City prevails on its specific performance claim.
If the City is required to litigate a damages phase as part of this matter, however, the City will
have to undertake this additional work on damages.

The deadline for the close of fact discovery and disclosure of initial expert reports will
have passed by the time this Court decides PBC's motion. Trial itself is less than two months
away. If PBC's last-minute motion for leave to amend were granted, the City would be
prevented from obtaining necessary discovery, timely retaining experts or adequately
preparing for an expedited jury trial on the issue of damages.

Hi, ARGUMENT
A. Legal Standards Governing the Amendment of Pleadings.

While FRCP 1 5(a) states that leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so
requires," leave to amend is not automatically granted. Leave to amend can be denied where
there is a justifying reason. Manzarek vy. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co , 519 F.3d 1025,
1034 (9th Cir. 2008). Before "deciding whether justice requires granting leave to amend,"
courts first determine whether any bases for denying the amendment exist. Moore v. Kayport
Package Express, inec., 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989), The Ninth Circuit has integrated
these threshold considerations in its FRCP 15(a) analysis: "Five factors are frequently used to

assess the propriety of a motion for leave to amend: (1) bad faith, (2) undue delay, (3)

prejudice to the opposing party, (4) futility of amendment; and (5) whether plaintiff has
previously amended his complaint." Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 373 (9th
Cir. 1990). The fifth consideration is not at issue here, but each of the first four is.

Prejudice is the central point of inquiry under FRCP 15(a). Eminence Capital, LLC v
Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003). Changing the nature of the case at this late
date would prejudice the City. Further, PBC's decision to wait until the last minute to file its
motion for leave to amend is bad faith and undue delay.

Finally, PBC's motion to amend is futile. The City is entitled to jury trial on the issue
of damages. PBC's request that this Court decide the amount of damages, therefore, cannot
be granted under any circumstances.

B. PBC's Last-Minute Amendment Would Dramatically Expand the Scope of this
Litigation, Prejudicing the City's Ability to Prepare Its Case Before the
Expedited Trial Date.

Contrary to PBC's representation, granting its motion for leave to amend would
change the entire nature of this litigation and dramatically expand its scope. PBC has known
from the beginning that, if the City's claim for specific performance were denied, the City's
claim for damages would be litigated afterward. Now, at virtually the last minute, PBC seeks
leave to amend to have an actual quantum of damages decided now. In light of the limited
time remaining before trial (and the close of factual discovery), granting PBC's unduly
delayed request to expand the scope of this litigation would be unfairly prejudicial to the City.

I. As Narrowed by Discovery, this Lawsuit Will Require the Court to
Resolve Only a Minimum Number of Discrete Issues,

Currently, the City seeks a declaration from this Court that it is entitled to specific
performance of the Lease.

* It is undisputed that there is a valid, binding contract (the Lease); that the Lease's

terms are definite and certain (PBC must play Sonics home games at KeyArena through the
2009-10 season); that PBC has threatened to breach the Lease (by relocating the Sonics to
Oklahoma City this fall); that the Lease contains a specific performance clause, and that the
Lease is free from unfairness, fraud, and overreaching. See Crafis v Pitts, 162 P.3d 382, 386
(Wash. 2007) (listing relevant factors stating the availability of specific performance as a
remedy).

* Since filing its arbitration demand, PBC has argued that to comply with the Lease
would allegedly cause it undue hardship. PBC has now agreed that undue hardship is not an
issue for PBC's owners.

* As aresult, the only major issue left for this Court to decide is whether damages are
an adequate remedy for the City's harm. Crafts, 162 P.3d at 386. If they are not, the City is
entitled to specific performance (subject to resolution of any other defenses asserted by PBC).
ld

To determine if damages are an adequate remedy, the legal considerations are (a)
whether the Sonics are unique, such that it would be difficult for the City to obtain a suitable
substitute for the Sonics as a tenant, or (b) whether the City's damages would be difficult to
prove with reasonable certainty. Jd. If either is true, PBC should be required to specifically
perform its contractual promise. /d This is because if the City cannot procure a suitable
substitute tenant, or if the City's damages would be difficult to prove with reasonable
certainty, then no remedy at law is as "plain, adequate, complete and efficient as the remedy
of specific performance ... ." Id. at 388 (quotation and citation omitted) (emphasis in
original).

PBC completely ignores the first issue: whether the City can procure a suitable

substitute tenant for the Sonics. The City expects to prove at trial that the Sonics are a unique

tenant, which bring unique benefits to the community of which they have been part for 41
years. This issue alone will likely prove sufficient to entitle the City to specific performance.
Determining whether damages can be proved with reasonable certainty (much less the amount
of damages) may, therefore, very well be unnecessary.

2. PBC's Request for Leave to Amend Would Require Determining an
Actual Quantum of Damages - a Different and Broader Issue than
Whether Damages Could Be Determined With Reasonable Certainty.

Because the City may be entitled to judgment in its favor on other grounds, this Court
might not even need to evaluate whether damages would be difficult to prove with reasonable
certainly. If it does, however, determining whether damages are measurable is a far cry from
what PBC asks in its motion ~ to decide what an appropriate measure of damages would be.
Whether damages can be quantified with reasonable certainty is one question. What the
quantum of damages would be is a different question. Trying the latter issue would require
the City to present different, and substantially more, evidence than whether the measure can
be quantified with reasonable certainty. PBC cannot fairly wait until the close of factual
discovery and then assert a counterclaim that would change the entire nature of the case.

PBC's suggestion that determining the amount of damages would involve a de
minimus inquiry into the amount of rent is simply false. The scope of the City's damages are
far larger than rent due. The City would be entitled to the full scope of the consequential
damages of PBC's breach. See Family Med Bldg., Inc v. State, Dep't of Social & Health
Servs., 702 P.2d 459, 464 (Wash. 1985). Establishing the amount of these damages would
require evidence on issues including the broad economic impact of the Sonics on the City of
Seattle. Such a measure may include taxes on both the direct and indirect economic activity
related to the Sonics' games, including employment taxes, parking revenues, and

entertainment and related spending before and after games.

3. The City Wiil Suffer Undue Prejudice if It is Required to Try the Issue of
Damages on an Expedited Basis Without the Chance to Conduct Full
Discovery.

Prejudice is the central point of inquiry under FRCP 15(a). Eminence Capital, 316
F.3d at 1052. If the non-moving party suffers prejudice as a result of a motion to amend, the
motion should be denied. Jd New claims unduly prejudice the non-moving party if brought
after the discovery deadline. See e.g, Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1292 (9th
Cir. 2000). Bringing a claim six days before the close of fact discovery is no different and
equally prejudicial.

A recent Seventh Circuit case, which involved facts very similar to those presented
here, is illustrative. In Campania Mgmt. Co. v Rooks, Pitts & Poust, 290 F.3d 843 (7th Cir,
2002), the Seventh Circuit held that a trial judge properly denied a defendant's motion to
amend its answer based on undue prejudice to the plaintiff. Defendant Campania
Management Company ("Campania") filed a motion to amend its answer "a mere six days
before the date for the close of discovery." Jd. at 846. The motion was brought slightly over
two months before trial. fd. at 846-47. The court held that the plaintiff would suffer
prejudice due to the untimely motion. /d at 849. The parties had not conducted discovery on
the subject and the amendment would have complicated an otherwise straightforward case.

id. at 850. The court held that denial of the "motion to amend was proper because Campania
failed to act with diligence and the proposed amendment would have injected a new issue into
the case on the eve of trial." /d. at 848. Additionally, Campania's proposed amendment
represented an attempt to reverse its prior positioning in order to change its trial strategy. Id.

at 846-47.' PBC's motion to amend, similarly, attempts to introduce a new counterclaim at

 

Moreover, the court noted that where an amendment would cause additional discovery costs,
the moving party must offer to reimburse the nonmoving party for its expenses, which
Campania had not done. /d. at 849.

the last minute that changes the nature of the case. It should be denied.

4, PBC's Last-Minute Motion to Amend is Unduly Delayed and in Bad
Faith.

There is no new evidence that PBC obtained during discovery that would justify
bringing this new and different counterclaim two months before an already expedited trial
date. See Chodos v. West Publ'g Co , 292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding a trial
court's denial of a motion to amend where the facts underlying the new claim were long
known to the party). The fact that damages might be at issue (if specific performance is
denied) has always been known. The Ninth Circuit has held that "[w]here the party seeking
amendment knows or should know of the facts upon which the proposed amendment is based
but fails to include them in the original [pleading], the motion to amend may be denied." De
Saracho v. Custom Food Mach., Inc., 206 F.3d 874, 878 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Jordan v.
County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1324 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 459
U.S. 810 (1982)). PBC made a tactical decision to seek an expedited trial on a singie issue:
the City's specific performance claim. It cannot at the last minute revise its tactics to broaden
the scope of issues being tried.

C. PBC's Proposed Amendment Would Require a Jury Trial on Damages.

PBC's motion for leave to amend should be denied for an additional reason - it is
futile, because the amount of damages for breach of a contract must be determined by a jury,
not this Court. See Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U.S. 340, 347-48, 352-

34 (1998) (damages in a common law claim must ultimately be tried to a jury). A declaratory

judgment by this Court as to what damages are in this suit would be res judicata, See In re

Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig , 623 F. Supp. 1466, 1473 (W.D. Wash. 1985). Such

a decision would improperly deny the City its right to a jury trial on damages. See Lytle v

Household Mfg , Inc, 494 U.S. 545, 550-51 (1990). The City properly preserved its right to a

jury trial, if this case ultimately encompassed claims other than the equitable issue of specific

performance. Jury Demand (Harrison Decl., Ex. 3). Thus, PBC is asking for relief it is by
definition not entitled to. If damages are tried, they must be tried to a jury.

D. Lf PBC's Motion to Amend Is Granted, Trial Should Be Postponed and
Bifurcated.

If the Court allows PBC's amendment, the City requests that trial be postponed for at
least six months." A jury trial on the City's multi-million dollar damages claim is
qualitatively different from this Court's trial of the City's declaratory judgment action for
equitable relief. Under ordinary circumstances, jury trial in such a case would not be
scheduled for well over a year from the scheduling conference. PBC claimed that the issue of
specific performance needed to be decided on an expedited basis so that it would be able, as a
practical matter, to relocate to Oklahoma City, if this Court ruled that specific performance
was not required. If PBC prefers to wait until a quantum of damages is decided before
relocating, it can do so. What it cannot do is force the City to try the issue of damages on an
expedited basis for the convenience of PBC.

Further, if this Court grants leave to amend and sets over the trial date, the City
requests that the issues of specific performance and damages be bifurcated at that trial.
Bifurcation will conserve the resources of the parties and the Court. For reasons of efficiency,
this Court can properly decide the City's equitable claim for specific performance first and
then - if necessary - send the issue of damages to a jury. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b); see also

Dollar Sys. Ine v. Avear Leasing Sys., Inc., 890 F.2d 165, 170-71 (9th Cir. 1989),

 

* If Amendment is not granted, the City remains prepared to try the declaratory judgment
action on its specific performance claim as currently scheduled.
