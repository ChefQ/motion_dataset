I. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), and LR 7(d)(2)(B), defendant PBC moves for leave to
file an amended answer to include a counterclaim for declaratory relief against the City of
Seattle.

The PBC has a lease with the City by which the Sonics play at KeyArena. There are two
seasons remaining under the lease. Subject to this Court's ruling, the Sonics intend to relocate to
Oklahoma City, either after this trial or at the end of the lease. On the current pleadings, the only
express claim is the City's claim for specific performance requiring the Sonics to continue
playing at KeyArena through the end of the lease.

Implicit in this claim is whether the City's damages - the rent for the remaining term of

the lease - can be calculated with reasonable certainty. At trial, the PBC will demonstrate that

the City's damages may be so calculated and that the City is otherwise barred from equitable
relief. Therefore, PBC hereby requests leave to amend to assert a counterclaim for declaratory
relief, asking that the Court declare the quantum of the City's damages should the Sonics not
play the remaining two seasons at the KeyArena. This will avoid the need for a follow-up trial
on this issue.
Il. STATEMENT OF FACTS

On September 21, 2007, the PBC filed an arbitration demand seeking a declaration that
the City would not be entitled to an order of specific performance if PBC did not play in
KeyArena for the final two seasons of the lease, but was prepared to pay the rent for those two
seasons. The City then sued the PBC, asking that the Sonics be enjoined to play in KeyArena for
the last two seasons. The Arbitration was then stayed. On February 8, 2008, this court entered a

scheduling order providing for expedited discovery and setting trial in this matter to begin on

 

June 16.
Il. ARGUMENT
The PBC Should Be Given Leave to Amend to Assert Its Counterclaim
1. Leave to Amend Is Freely Given

 

Leave to amend shall be "freely give[n] . . . when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P.
15(a). Furthermore, Rule 15's policies favoring amendments must be applied with "extreme
liberality."! Chodos v. W. Pub. Co., 929 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir. 2002). When considering a
motion for leave to amend, the district court must consider whether the proposed amendment
results from "undue delay, is made in bad faith, will cause prejudice to the opposing party, or as
a dilatory tactic." Chodos, 292 F.3d at 1003. And this determination should be made with all
inferences in favor of granting the motion. Griggs v. Pace Am. Group, Inc., 170 F.3d 877, 890

(9th Cir. 1999).

 

' The "extreme liberality" favoring amendments to pleadings applies to counterclaims.
Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Arnold, 283 F.2d 406 (9" Cir. 1960); Cooper Dev. Co. v. Employers
Ins. of Wausau, 765 F. Supp. 1429 (N.D.Cal.1991)(same); 6 Wright & Miller Fed. Prac. & Proc.

2. The Availability of Specific Performance Necessarily Requires a Determination of
Whether the City's Damages Would Be Reasonably Ascertainable.

The extraordinary remedy of specific performance is only available if the legal remedy of
damages is inadequate. The factors bearing on the adequacy of the legal remedy include "the
difficulty of proving damages with reasonable certainty." Crafts v. Pitts, 161 Wn.2d 16, 162
P.3d 382 (2007). The City, as landlord, says the Sonics provide it with both "tangible" and
"intangible" benefits. Cmpl. at cent 6. The City claims that if the Sonics were to leave early, the
City's damages would include "intangible" losses. Cmpl. at 24. Thus, the City says that
damages are an inadequate remedy and that it is therefore entitled to specific performance.
Washington law provides no support for such a claim. Indeed, it "has long been held in
Washington that there is an adequate remedy at law in damages for the breach of a lease
agreement." Wash. Trust Bank v. Circle K Corp. 15 Wn. App. 89, 546 P.2d 1249 (1976)
(denying landlord's specific performance claim).

The factual and legal merits of the City's claims regarding "intangible" damages need not
be addressed here. Instead, whether the City's damages - i.e., the rent owing - can be calculated
with reasonable certainty will necessarily be an issue for trial. If the PBC proves the City's
compensable damages can be so calculated and that damages are an otherwise proper remedy,
specific performance must be denied and the Court should enter a declaratory judgment
regarding the amount of damages the City would incur from an early departure.

Alternatively, the Court can deny specific performance for reasons other than the
certainty with which damages may be calculated. Here, for example, the City has unclean hands:
The just-obtained Griffin documents show that the City is using the lawsuit to try to force the
PBC to sell the team to the City's preferred group of owners. But equity requires the Court to
ensure that specific performance "will not be oppressive, unconscionable, or result in undue

hardship to any party involved." If the Court concludes that the City is not entitled to the

equitable relief it purports to seek, it should nevertheless declare the damages it finds would

result from an early departure so that the matter need not be tried again.

IV. CONCLUSION

Amendment allowing PBC to assert its counterclaim for declaratory relief will not

prejudice the City. Because the evidence presented at trial will, by necessity, require

determination of the rent owed should PBC leave two years early, such an amendment would

simply make express what is already being tried implicitly between the parties. If specific

performance is not ordered, it would be a waste of judicial resources to have a second proceeding

to determine the rent. Accordingly, leave should be granted. A proposed amended answer,

revised only to add a counterclaim for declaratory relief, is attached as Exhibit A.

DATED this 24th day of April, 2008.
