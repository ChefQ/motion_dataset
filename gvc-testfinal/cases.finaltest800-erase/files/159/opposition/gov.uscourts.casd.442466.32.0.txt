5 Indictment. [Dkt. 18.]

ARGUMENT

8

Defendant brings to this Court’s attention United States v. Aguilera-Rios, ---

9 F.3d ---, 2014 WL 2723766 (9th Cir. 2014), a recent Ninth Circuit opinion that
10 applied post-removal precedent to find that the defendant was not removable as
11 charged at the time of his deportation. Id. at *4. This Court may reject Defendant’s
12 argument that Aguilera-Rios leads to a different result in his case, however, because
13 Aguilera-Rios is distinguishable on its facts, and even if this Court accepts
14 Defendant’s argument as to his June 7, 1999 IJ Order, this Court has already found
15 that his July 18, 2012 Expedited Removal was a proper deportation.

Because

16 Defendant raises no new arguments as to his Expedited Removal, and this Court has
17 already found that Defendant’s Expedited Removal was a valid deportation, this Court
18 should deny Defendant’s motion for reconsideration.

A. Aguilera-Rios Is Distinguishable Because Defendant Has Not Exhausted
His Administrative Remedies
In Aguilera-Rios, the Government recognized that the defendant had exhausted
his administrative remedies. Aguilera-Rios, 2014 WL 2723766, at *2. Similarly in
United States v. Camacho-Lopez, 450 F.3d 928 (9th Cir. 2006), the United States
conceded that the defendant had, based on the facts of that case, exhausted his
administrative remedies. Here, as the United States noted previously, Defendant has
done nothing to exhaust his administrative remedies and exhaustion is not excused.
Because the United States has not conceded that Defendant exhausted his

28
United States R&O to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

2

14-CR-1308-LAB

1 administrative remedies, his reliance on Camacho-Lopez and Aguilera-Rios to
2 establish this element is without merit. [See Def. Mot. at 4.]
3

An alien fails to exhaust remedies if he does not file a direct appeal from his

4 order of removal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”). See United States v.
5 Garza-Sanchez, 217 F.3d 806, 808 (9th Cir. 2000) (“A defendant charged under
6 8 U.S.C. § 1326 may not collaterally attack the underlying deportation order if he or
7 she did not exhaust administrative remedies in the deportation proceedings, including
8 direct appeal of the deportation order.”); cf. Rashtabadi v. INS, 23 F.3d 1562, 1567
9 (9th Cir. 1994) (“Failure to raise an issue in an appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure
10 to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction
11 to hear the matter.”). Here, Defendant never filed an appeal to the BIA from his order
12 of removal. On the contrary, despite being informed of that right in plain language in
13 the group advisal stage of his removal hearing [Ex. 3 to Government’s Response and
14 Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count 2, Dkt. 18, (IJ: “[I]f you disagree
15 with my decision you will have the right to appeal it to the board of immigration
16 proceedings. You may also accept the decision.”)], Defendant expressly waived that
17 right at the end of his individual hearing, and left no doubt such was his choice. [Ex.
18 3 (IJ: “You have the right to appeal my decision if you disagree with it or you may
19 accept my decision. What you would you like to do?” Defendant: “I accept it.”).]
20

Under controlling law, this waiver was considered and intelligent, i.e., valid.

21 United States v. Estrada-Torres, 179 F.3d 776, 781 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam)
22 (considered and intelligent waiver where the IJ “asked Estrada-Torres individually,
23 ‘Do you accept the decision or wish to appeal?,’” and alien noted his acceptance),
24 overruled other grounds by United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.
25 2001) (en banc); United States v. Chavez-Huerto, 972 F.2d 1087, 1088-89 (9th Cir.
26 1992) (considered and intelligent waiver where, after stating that “if you agree with
27 my decision you may accept it as final. However, if you do not agree with my
28
United States R&O to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

3

14-CR-1308-LAB

1 decision, you have the right to appeal my decision to a higher court[,]” the IJ asked
2 alien individually, “Mr. Rodrigo Chavez-Huerto, do you wish to appeal or do you
3 accept the decision?,” and alien replied, “I accept the decision.”).
4

Defendant claims that his waiver was not “considered and intelligent” and

5 therefore exhaustion was excused because he was not properly advised regarding
6 relief for which he was eligible. See United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d
7 1042, 1049 (9th Cir. 2003) (defendant exempt from exhaustion requirement “because
8 the IJ did not inform him that he was eligible for relief from deportation.”); United
9 States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 F.3d 1088, 1096 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Because the IJ erred
10 when she told Pallares that no relief was available, Pallares’ failure to exhaust his
11 administrative remedies cannot bar collateral review of his deportation proceeding.”);
12 cf. United States v. Hernandez-Arias, 745 F.3d 1275, 1280 (9th Cir. 2014) (“If the
13 alien establishes a due process violation that prevented his waiver of appeal from
14 being knowing and intelligent, he is excused from the exhaustion requirement.”)
15

But as the Ninth Circuit has held, in determining whether an IJ properly

16 informed an alien of his eligibility for relief, the Court must look to the law at the time
17 of the deportation. United States v. Vidal-Mendoza, 705 F.3d 1012, 1017 (9th Cir.
18 2013) (holding that an IJ must inform alien of eligibility for relief “under the
19 applicable law at the time of his deportation hearing” and that an IJ “need not
20 anticipate future ‘change[s] in law’” when determining eligibility for relief from
21 removal). Here, at the time of Defendant’s deportation, the BIA had held that DUI
22 was an aggravated felony. See In re Magallanes-Garcia, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1 (BIA
23 March 19, 1998) (construing Arizona DUI and concluding that it was a crime of
24 violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) and therefore an aggravated felony).

Shortly

25 thereafter, the BIA held, en banc, that DUI was an aggravated felony. See In re
26 Puente-Salazar, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1006 (BIA Sept. 29, 1999) (construing Texas DUI).
27 Thus as the IJ correctly noted, at the time Defendant was deported “driving under the
28
United States R&O to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

4

14-CR-1308-LAB

1 influence of alcohol has been determined to be a crime of violence by the board of
2 immigration appeals.” [Ex. 3.] Defendant was therefore correctly advised as to his
3 eligibility for relief, and exhaustion is not excused. See Vidal-Mendoza, 705 F.3d at
4 1017; Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d at 1049.
5

Defendant’s assertion that he was not removable as charged does not change the

6 exhaustion analysis. If an IJ never tells an alien about relief for which he could have
7 applied, the alien cannot meaningfully waive his right to appeal from the failure to
8 grant that relief, therefore exhaustion is excused. See United States v. Arrieta, 224
9 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000) (“an alien who is not made aware that he has a right
10 to seek relief necessarily has no meaningful opportunity to appeal the fact that he was
11 not advised of that right”). This same issue does not arise as to the removability stage
12 of the proceedings. Long before an alien even sets his first foot before an IJ, he will
13 already know the charges upon which he stands to be removed, as they must be listed
14 in a Notice to Appear. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(b)(4) (Notice to Appear “must”
15 include “[t]he charges against the alien and statutory provisions alleged to have been
16 violated”). Further, the law is clear that aliens can only be removed for charges
17 actually listed in a Notice to Appear. See Al Mutarreb v. Holder, 561 F.3d 1023, 1029
18 & n.8 (9th Cir. 2009). So, an alien will always know the charge the IJ sustained in
19 finding him removable – such that if he disagrees with that ruling, he already knows
20 everything he needs to know to meaningfully waive (or exercise) his right to appeal
21 that ruling.
22

Because Defendant has not met his obligation to establish exhaustion of his

23 administrative remedies, and cannot do so, the Court should deny his motion for
24 reconsideration.

B. Defendant’s Collateral Attack of His July 18, 2012 Expedited Removal
Still Fails
Even accepting Defendant’s argument that exhaustion is excused, this Court
correctly relied upon Defendant’s Expedited Removal as an additional basis on which
to deny Defendant’s 1326(d) motion. The United States fully briefed this issue in its
first motion response, and Court has already held that Defendant’s Expedited Removal
was a valid deportation. Because Defendant does no more than re-raise the arguments

7

this Court has already rejected, this Court should deny his motion.
