Case 2:11-cv-01445-MJP Document 62 Filed 05/03/12 Page 1 of 4

THE HON. MARSHA J. PECHMAN

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
AT SEATTLE

TRAVIS MICKELSON, et. ux.
Plaintiffs, NO. 2:11-cv-01445

VS.
OBJECTION TO

CHASE HOME FINANCE LLC, et. al. CONSIDERATION OF NEW
EVIDENCE IN RESPONSE TO
Defendants. MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION FOR
MOTION TO DISMISS AS
OPPOSED TO SUMMARY
JUDGMENT

 

 

 

As the Ninth Circuit stated in Balderas:

"[S]o long as the plaintiff alleges facts to support a theory that is not facially
implausible, the court's skepticism is best reserved for later stages of the
proceedings when the plaintiff case can be rejected on evidentiary grounds." A
complaint containing allegations that, if proven, present a winning case is not
subject to dismissal under 12(b)(6), no matter how unlikely such winning
outcome may appear to the district court.

Balderas v. Countrywide Bank, N.A., No. 10-55064, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 25957 (9th Cir.,
Dec. 29, 2011), at *11-12 (internal citations omitted). To the extent plaintiffs have pled
evidence, even doubtful evidence not likely to be believed at trial, our system generally

contemplates a trial or motion pursuant to CR 56 will be necessary to finally resolve disputes;

not motions to dismiss based on the pleadings or their reconsideration thereof. In holding that
an exhibit attached to a pleading was not adequate to prove an absence of fact, where it could
be rebutted at trial, the Ninth Circuit ruled:
But Exhibit 14 only proved that the Balderases signed the document in
Countrywide's possession. The acknowledgment created a _ rebuttable
presumption that the required disclosures were delivered to the borrowers. ...
This presumption will no doubt be very valuable to Countrywide when the trier
of fact is called on to decide whether the Balderases did or did not get proper
TILA notice. But evidentiary presumptions "are inappropriate for evaluation at
the pleadings stage." 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal
Practice & Procedure 0x00A7 1357 (Supp. 2011). The Balderases allege in their
complaint that they did not, in fact, get a properly prepared notice. If they

testify to that effect at trial, the trier of fact could believe them, despite their
signed statement to the contrary.

(W.D. Wash. Feb. 3 2012).

Defendants claim through introduction of alleged evidentiary filings by NWTS that
Chase was the Credit Bidder for Freddie Mac

The Mickelsons did not plead implausible facts or legal theories; including the one
being challenged pursuant to this motion to reconsider. From the beginning, the Mickelsons
alleged Freddie Mac did not have authority under Washington's Deed of Trust Act (DTA) to
make a credit bid. In their response to this motion, Defendants argue that they complied with
the law, but did so through asserted facts suggesting it had legal authority to do so. The
trouble is the defendant's theory is based on new allegations placed into evidence in an

inadmissible way.

Indeed, NWTS alternating declarations about who made the credit bid and how this

bidding process occurred raise credibility issues a jury should resolve about the different

versions of facts. Balderas v. Countrywide Bank, N.A., supra. Further, defendants present no

evidence to support their later theory.

The Court and the Mickelsons should be allowed to see this evidence before their
complaint is dismissed out of hand in light of this Court's previous observations of the likely
robo-signing which has already gone on in this case; this Court's acknowledgement of the
ongoing MERS litigation; and the strong policy of our Courts to resolve cases on the merits,

i.e. through trial or motions pursuant to F.R.C.P. 56
