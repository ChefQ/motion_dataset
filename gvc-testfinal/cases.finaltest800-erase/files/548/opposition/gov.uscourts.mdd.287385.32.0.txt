Introduction
Plaintiffs' Claims arise from a traffic stop on July 17,2013 that turned into an assault and

26

battery, false arrest and various other torts made in the complaint that took place on the corner of Loch

27

Raven and Argonne Drive in Baltimore City, Maryland. Police Nathan Wmer knowingly and willingly

28

assaulted and battered, falsely arrested, used excessive force violating the Plaintiffs inalienable rights all

29

listed in the complaint that are protected by Untied States and Maryland Constitutions. The Mayor

30

appointed the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City and City Council of Baltimore confirmed by a

31

majority vote of its members. Baltimore City Police department has established and practiced an illegal,

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 2 of 8

32

unlawful and unconstitutional practice of violating inhabitant's rights as a means to its law enforcement.

33

Mayor and City Councils backs this unlawful behavior by not making the appropriate changes needed to

34

cure its problem.

I. ARGUMENT

57

1. The City does control the Baltimore Police Department,

58

its officers and its employees.

The City does control the Baltimore Police Department and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is

59

responsible in both her capacities for hiring and appointing The Commissioner in charge of Baltimore

60

Police Department. As to many types of non constitutional tort actions, including those sounding in

61

negligence, Baltimore City is immune with regard to matters classified as governmental and not immune

62

with regard to matters classified as proprietary. Clea v. City of Baltimore (312 Md. 662, 1988).

63

Proprietarily, the Mayor has custodial responsibility for the Baltimore City Police and its Commissioner.

64

In Reed v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore 171 Md. 115, 188 A. 15 (1936), the court said that the

65

city's duty to the public was comparable to that of a department store owner to his customers.

66

A municipality is subject to suit under

9

1983, see Monell v. Dep't Soc. Serv., 436 U.S. 658,690

67

(1978). In addition to formal decision making, a policy or custom may "be inferred from continued

68

inaction in the face of a known history of widespread constitutional deprivations on the part of city

69

employees." Id. at 229-30; see also Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1390-91 (4th Cir. 1987) (stating

70

that a municipality can be liable where its employees unconstitutional practices become sufficiently

71

widespread that they assume the quality of "custom or usage," and responsible policymakers, who have

72

actual or constructive knowledge of these practices, fail "as a matter of specific intent or deliberate

73

indifference" to correct the practices). The Police "engaged in acts and omissions under the color law

74

and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs, and usages of the State of Maryland, the

75

City of Baltimore, and under the authority of the Mayor's office as police officers for such city".

3

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 4 of 8

76

In Cooper v. Dillon 403 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 2005) the court held that a state statute was not

77

mandatory and required conscious enforcement, and the city chose to enforce it. Thus, if you adopt it

78

and make it your own, it becomes your policy. A municipality is liable when the constitutional injury to

79

the plaintiff resulted from the implementation or "execution of a government's policy or custom, whether

80

made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,

81

inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under ~1983" Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.

82

A municipal entity may not be held liable under respondeat superior but may only be held liable for

83

damage caused by an entity's "lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to

84

represent official policy." Monell, 436 U.S. at 694. See also Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1387 (4th

85

Cir. 1987) ("Because municipal liability results only when the municipality itself can be directly charged

86

with fault for a constitutional violation, it results only when policy or custom as above defined is (I)

87

fairly attributable to the municipality as its 'own,' and is (2) the 'moving force' behind the particular

88

constitutional violation" (citations and footnote omitted».

89

The act whence the injury arose was done in obedience to a "mandatory" statue; the city was

90

thus behaving as a mere instrumentality of the state. On the other hand, where the statue, in the

91

execution of which the wrong occurred is "permissive" or "discretionary" the city's undertaking in

92

relation there to subjects the city to the liability of a private person. Police had "discretion" and failed to

93

use that discretion with malice toward the Plaintiff. "When a statue confers a power upon a corporation

94

to be exercised for the public good, the exercise of the power is not merely discretionary but imperative

95

and the words 'power and authority' in such case may be construed duty and obligation." Baltimore v.

96

Marriott 9 Md. 160,174 (1856).

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 5 of 8

98
99

Plaintiffs argument on the issue of control by text of Article II

9 27 of the

City Charter without

elaboration or explanation is because it is clear, it grants the Mayor and City Council the power to

100

exercise the police power "to the same extent as the State could exercise." It does not ignore the

101

provision of Article II

102

because that is clear as well "no ordinance of the City or act of any municipal officer, 'OTHER than the

103

act of the MAYOR' pursuant to Article IV oftbis Charter, Shall conflict, impede, obstruct, hinder or

104

interfere with the powers of the Police Commissioner." Clark, 404 Md. At 23. (quoting Baltimore City

105

Charter, art. II

106

Charter has the power and authority to interfere with the powers of the Police Commissioner.

9 27.)

9 27,

and that the Maryland Court of Appeals relied on for its holding in Clark

This states that the MAYOR "pursuant" to Article IV of the Baltimore City

107
108

Article IV Mayor 4. General powers.

109

(a) Conservator o(peace; financial aversight; report on state a/City.

110

The Mayor, by virtue of the office, shall have all the powers of a conservator of the peace.

111

(b) Chief executive officer.

112

The Mayor shall be the chief executive officer of the City, shall see that ordinances and

113

resolutions are duly and faithfully executed, "and shall have general supervision over all

114

municipal officers and agencies."

115
116

Mayor and City Council has the power to exercise the police power "to the same extent as the

117

State could exercise. The Mayor is the Chief executive officer of the City and has general supervision

118

over "ALL" municipal officers and agencies.

119

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 6 of 8

120

II. Plaintiffs 42 18 U.S.c. ~ 242 claims are valid claims for deprivation of rights under the

121

color of law. Government will not charge Government with a crime that decision is left to the

122

people.

123

The Supremacy Clause is the provision in Article Six, Clause 2 ofthe U.S. Constitution that

124

establishes the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and U.S. treaties as "the supreme law of the land".

125

Constitution of Maryland Art. 2. The Constitution of the United States, and the Laws made, or which

126

shall be made, in pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority

127

of the United States, are, and shall be the Supreme Law of the State; and the Judges of this State, and all

128

the People of this State, are, and shall be bound thereby; anything in the Constitution or Law of this

129

State to the contrary notwithstanding. Claims under 18 U.s.c. 9242 are valid because there is a clear

130

congressional intent to provide a civil remedy. Plaintiff seeks proper relief from the criminal acting's in

131

connection to suit for a jury to decide if the Statue was in fact violated. 18 U.s.c. 9242 states,

132

"Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects

133

any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of

134

any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected hy the Constitution or laws ofthe

135

United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being

136

an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens,

137

shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if bodily injury

138

results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include the use,

139

attempted use, or threatened use of a dangerous weapon, explosives, or fire, shall be fined

140

under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts

141

committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to

6

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 7 of 8

142

kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an

143

attempt to kill, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or

144

both, or may be sentenced to death."

145

(Emphasis added.)

146

The addition of 18 U.S.C. S 242 to suit, does not seek civil remedy but its criminal penalties

147

because of the deprivation of rights, privileges secured and protected by the Constitution or laws

148

of the United States and if bodily injury results from the acts committed in violation or if such

149

acts include the use, attempted use, or threatened use of a dangerous weapon.

150

It's the prosecutor's duty to bring suits of this nature forward but since it brings forth a

151

conflict of interest these types of cases almost are never tried by prosecutors. Therefore the only

152

remedy is a jury to find guilt. If civil liability was to be found on the defendants, then probable

153

cause should exist that a crime has been committed and case should be forwarded to a grand jury

154

for bring fourth and indictment (true bill) against the guilty parties.

155

The notions of bringing fourth criminal charges in civil forums are not foreign. Court of general

156

jurisdiction having unlimited trial jurisdiction serves both civil and criminal. Its vary Courts

157

where civil cases are made criminal by way of unconstitutional statues. (i.e. infractions to SITA,

158

child support etc.)

159
160

CONCLUSION
Clearly discussed above, the Supreme Laws of Land disproves any defenses stated by the

161

defendants. Weather the Baltimore City Police is an agency of the State or the City of Baltimore they all

162

work together to support the functions of government and all have taken an oath faithfully to perform

163

the duties of their offices, and to support the laws and constitutions of the United States and of the State

7

Case 1:14-cv-02470-RDB Document 32 Filed 09/04/14 Page 8 of 8

164

of Maryland. Above statements demonstrates the control the Mayor and City Council has over the

165

Baltimore Police Department and the reason 18 U.S.c. ~ 242 was in addition to suit.

166
167
168

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this honorable Court to deny defendants motion
to dismiss.
