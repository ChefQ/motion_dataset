Introduction
On June 7,2005, Defendants, Portsmouth Police Department, Michael Arnold, Anthony

Carnbrola, Garrett Coyne, Robert Driscoll, Jeffrey Furtado, Steven Hoetel, Harry Leonard,
Alberto Bucci and Dennis Seale, individually and in their official capacities as employees of the
Town of Portsmouth (hereinafter "Town defendants"), removed the above entitled matter from
the Newport County Superior Court to the Federal District Court for the District of Rhode
1sland.I This removal was based upon this Court's original jurisdiction pursuant to 42 US. C. $
1331 over plaintirs claims for the alleged violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights. Plaintiff

thereafter filed the instant Motion to Remand.
Defendants hereby object to plaintiffs Motion to Remand and submit this matter was
properly removed based on this Court's original jurisdiction. In light of the fact that the scope of
the issues, damages and evidence in support of the claims are all essentially the same, plaintips
state law claims do not predominate the instant cause of action. McNernv v. Neb. Pub. Power
I

On June 13,2005, co-defendant Josephine Horton joined in this removal by filing her own Notice of Removal.

Dist., 309 F.Supp. I1 09, 1118 (D. Neb,. 2004). In addition, plaintiffs claim under Rhode Island
Access to Public Records statute does not involve such a novel or complex issue such to warrant
remand of the instant matter. Accordingly, plaintiffs Motion to Remand should be denied.
11.

Argument
The instant action arises from plaintiffs arrest for felony domestic assault in July 2004.

According to plaintiffs complaint, plaintiff was arrested based on false allegations by his
estranged wife. As a result of the defendants' actions on July 24,2004, plaintiff seeks to recover
damages based on the following theories of recovery:
Count I - False Arrest against all defendants for alleged violation of state law and the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments;
Count I1 - False Imprisonment against all Town defendants for the alleged violation of
state law and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments;
Count IV - 42 US.C. j 198.3 claim against all defendants stemming from plaintiffs
alleged false arrest and false imprisonment as well as a claim for denial of
due process stemming from the alleged denial of public records;
Count V - 42 US.C. ยง 1983 claim against the Town defendants for failure to train and
supervise;
Count VI - "Tort of Outrage" against all defendants stemming from the alleged attempt
to frame plaintiff in alleged violation of state law and plaintiffs Fourth, Sixth
and Fourteenth Amendment rights;
Count VII - False reporting claim against defendant Josephine Horton;
Count VIII - Malicious prosecution claim against defendant Josephine Horton;
Count IX - Abuse of Process claim against defendant Josephine Horton.
Plaintiff has made one additional claim against the Town defendants for the alleged "tortious
denial of public records." See PlaintiffS Complaint, Count 111. According to plaintiff, he
attempted to obtain a copy of the police files and statements in the months following his arrest
and was allegedly denied access.

In support of his Motion to Remand, plaintiff first alleges that because the state court has
concurrent jurisdiction over plaintiffs j 1983 claims, the matter may not be removed. Plaintws
Memorandum, at 4. Defendants submit that while plaintiff has correctly cited the dicta from the
District Court for the Northern District of California case cited, that is simply not the law in this
Circuit or the majority of Circuits. As explained by Sixth Circuit, "[tlhe weight of judicial
authority supports the conclusion that 'a Congressional grant of concurrent jurisdiction in a
statute does not imply that removal is prohibited."' Dorsev v. City o f Detroit, 858 F.2d 338, 341
(dhCir. 1988) citations omitted. Thus, the mere fact that the state and federal courts have
concurrent jurisdiction over the civil rights claims does not preclude the removal of the instant
action.
Defendants submit that there can be no dispute that this Court has original jurisdiction
over plaintiffs constitutional claims. As provided in 28 US.C. j 1367(a), "[iln any civil action
of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental
jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original
jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy." 28 U.S.C.$1367(a). This
section operates to confer supplemental jurisdiction to hear "state-law claims that arise from the
same nucleus of operative facts." Roche v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Comvanv, 81
F.3d 249, 256 (1"' Cir. 1996). In the instant case, all of plaintiffs state law claims stem from his
arrest on July 24,2004, including plaintiffs claimed attempts to gain access to the police reports
and witness statements. This Court thus has supplemental jurisdiction over these state law
claims. Murphv v. Bd o f Education, 455 F. Supp 390 (ED 1978) affd without op 594 F. 2d 869
(8IhCir. 1979) (Ifadiudication of claim depends upon application of either Constitution or laws
of United States, entire case is removable under 28 US.C. $1 441 (c)).

In apparent recognition that this Court possesses supplemental jurisdiction over the state
law claims, plaintiff argues that this court should exercise its discretion and decline to exercise
that jurisdiction because 1) the state law claims predominate the instant cause of action and 2).
the claim raises a novel and complex issue of state law. Plaint@'s

Memorandum, at 4.

Defendants submit in the first instance that there is no basis to plaintiffs claim that the
state law claims predominate the instant action. In order to find predominance such to warrant
remand, the Court must find that "a state claim constitutes the real body of a case, to which the
federal claim is only an appendage." De Asencio v. Tvson Foods, Inc,, 342 F.3d 301, 309 (3d
Cir. 2003) quoting Gibbs, 383 US. at 727. In this case, plaintiff points to the denial of public
records and alleged issues relating to his on-going family court dispute with co-defendant as the
basis for the conclusion that the state claims predominate the instant case. However, all of
plaintiffs causes of action specifically relate to plaintiffs alleged unlawful arrest and the
subsequent attempts to retrieve copies of the police reports and witness statements. Although in
the Motion to Remand, plaintiff alleges that "merely . . . two (2) of the nine (9) counts in
plaintiffs complaint involve the federal civil rights statutes {sic), 42 U. S.C. 5 1983," review of
plaintiffs Complaint demonstrates that actually five (5) of the nine (9) counts allege a violation
of plaintiffs constitutional rights. Of the remaining four (4) counts, three (3) are state law
claims likewise stemming from the actual arrest of plaintiff (malicious prosecution, abuse of
process and "tort of attempt to frame"). The final claim, which plaintiff bases the instant motion
on, is a claim for an alleged violation of R.I. Access to Public Records statute stemming from
plaintips alleged denial of access to the police reports and witness statements stemming from
his July 2004 arrest. Notably, in Count Four, plaintiff further alleges that this denial of public
records amounted to a violation of plaintiffs due process rights in violation of j1983.

Defendants thus submit that even though plaintiff has made additional state law claims,
these claims clearly do not predominate the instant action. Rather, considering that "the scope of
the issues presented, the damages alleged, and the evidence required to prove the state and
federal claims are substantially the same . . . [sluch circumstances do not support an argument
that the federal claim is dominated by or a mere appendage to the alleged state claims. McNernv

v. Neb. Pub. Power Dist., 309 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 11I8 (D. Neb., 2004) citing Williams v.
Ragnone, 147 F. 3d 700, 703 (8th Cir. 1998) (district court lacked discretion to refuse
supplementaljurisdiction and remand state tort claims arisingpom same case or controversy as
section 1983 claim of excessiveforce); McLaurin v. Prater, 30 F.3d 982, 985 (8th Cir. 1994).
(wherefactual basesfor inmate's j 1983 claim and state tort claims were closely related, court
could not refuse to exercise supplementaljurisdiction and substantial interests would be sewed
by having the district court rule on the state-law claims); Karstens v. International Gamco, Inc.,
939 F. Supp. 1430, 1441 (D. Neb. 1996)(state infliction of emotional distress claim did not
substantiallypredominate over Title VII discrimination claim based on the same facts and, even
if court had discretion to refusejurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction was warranted where

separate trials would be duplicative). Plaintiffs Motion to Remand based on the claim that the
state law claims predominate should accordingly be denied.2
Defendants also submit that plaintiffs claim under the Access to Public Records Act
does not involve such a novel or complex issue as to divest this court of jurisdiction over the
claim. While plaintiff cites to the statutory provision providing that police reports reflecting the
initial arrest of an individual are considered public records, this sentence cannot be read in
isolation of the previous sentences in that subsection which specifically exempts records of

Plaintiff makes an additional reference to the "family law and domestic-violence response procedures" allegedly
involved in the instant case as forming a basis to order remand. However, resolution of plaintiffs civil rights and

38-2-2(i)(4)(D). Although plaintiff claims that this is a novel issue, in fact, the Superior Court
and the R.I. Attorney General have addressed when such police reports are exempt fiom access
under 38-2-2(i)(4)(D)because of an ongoing enforcement proceeding.

Newport Police Department, ADV PR 99-03 (fgranting criminal defendant access to reports

interfere with enforcement proceeding, documents not public records). While there is not an
overwhelming amount of case law interpreting this particular portion of the statute, this Court is
clearly in a position to examine the plain language of the statute and apply it to the instant case.
Plaintiff finally alleges that "fairness, judicial economy, convenience, and comity"
require the Court to refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims. Plaintiff
specifically points to the inconvenience he will face because his current attorney is not admitted
to District Court. However, it is first noteworthy that such convenience concerns only "apply
when the district court views the state claim as predominant or novel or complex under
subsections 1367(c)(l) and (2), . . . [or] when the district court dismisses the federal claim and
re-examines its jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims under section 1367(c)(3). AIper
