DEFENDANT JOSEPHINE HORTON'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IS SUPPORT OF
HER OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND.

I.

Introduction:
On June 7,2005 and June 13,2005, petitions were filed to remove the above matter from

the Newport County Superior Court to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode
Island. This removal was based on the original jurisdiction supplied to this Court by 42 U.S.C.

5

1331 over Plaintiffs claims because the complaint alleges violations of both his Constitutional
Rights and Federal Laws. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand.

I1

Argument.
Defendant Josephine Horton hereby objects to the Plaintiffs motion to remand and

submits that this matter is properly before this Court based on its original subject matter
jurisdiction. While Plaintiff contends that State Law Claims predominate this matter and remand
is in order, a review of the complaint reveals that the Plaintiff has in Counts I, 11, IV, V, and VI
alleged violations of either his Constitutional Rights or Federal Law.
The fact that the Plaintiff claims in four counts of the complaint violations of exclusively
state law claims i.e., false reporting, malicious prosecution, abuse of process and access to public

Case 1:05-cv-00247-T-DLM

records, ignores 28 U.S.C.

1367(a) which provides that when it is alleged that the Defendant

has committed a violation of the Plaintiffs Constitution rights, the United States District Court
shall have jurisdiction over "all [state law] claims that are so related to claims in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy." The basis
of all of the Plaintiffs claims is that he was alleged falsely arrested on or about July 24,2004.
The fact that the Plaintiff has alleged a violation of 42 U.S.C.

8 1981' in two counts of

the complaint are in~pposite.~
There is no case law which suggest that State Courts have sole
jurisdiction over 42 U.S.C.

8 1981.

While this Court has the discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs
claims if the state law claims predominate the federal claim such that the state claim is the real
body of the complaint and the federal claim is but an appendage. DeAsencio v. T ~ s o nFoods,
'Plaintiffs complaint attempts to allege a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981. There is no
mention of 42 U.S.C. 9 1983 anywhere in the complaint. Accordingly, this argument of the
Plaintiffs will not be addressed.
242U.S.C tj 1981 provides: "
(a) Statement of equal rights
All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State
and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and
equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses,
and exactions of every kind, and to no other.
(b) "Make and enforce contracts" defined
For purposes of this section, the term "make and enforce contracts" includes the making,
performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits,
privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.

(c) Protection against impairment
The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental
discrimination and impairment under color of State law."
