I.

INTRODUCTION

As the Court knows, Relator tried to prevent Defendants from obtaining discovery
about his taking, use, and disclosure of Defendants’ privileged documents, castigating
Defendants for “assum[ing] some sort of impropriety where none exists.” Yet, once the Court
ordered that discovery, it showed that Relator had misled the Court and confirmed
Defendants’ concerns: Relator told the Court he “did not ‘surreptitiously take’” Defendants’
privileged documents. He did. Relator assured the Court that his “counsel did not rely on the
[privileged] documents.” They did. Relator declared that he and his attorneys “destroyed
their only copies of the [privileged] documents.” They did not. Relator asserted that Berg &
Androphy never even “received [the privileged documents] from Relator or had them in its
case file.” They did. Relator said he acquired the privileged documents in “the ordinary
course of his employment.” Not so. And for more than one year, Relator concealed his
destruction of relevant evidence.
The evidence now shows that, for the past four years, Relator has deployed a series of
abusive litigation tactics that have tainted this case beyond repair. While he was still working
for Defendants, Relator secretly copied for use in this lawsuit more than two thousand pages
of Defendants’ confidential documents, including documents that the Court has determined to
be privileged (the “Privileged Documents”). When he left his employment, Relator breached
his contractual promises to Defendants by retaining this secret cache of privileged and other
confidential documents, again for the purpose of using the documents against Defendants in
this suit.

Relator repeatedly mined this collection and sent selected documents to his

attorneys.

After the complaint was unsealed, Relator sent the entire collection to his

attorneys, despite knowing some of the documents were privileged and being warned not to
do so. Relator’s attorneys reviewed the documents “in full,” retained them for more than two
months without notifying Defendants, and used them against Defendants in this litigation.
This specifically includes the Privileged Documents, which Relator now admits his attorneys

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-1Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 8 of 49

“accessed . . . to prepare initial disclosures, and in preparing to challenge any assertion of
privilege.”

And when Defendants finally learned of Relator’s misconduct and sought

discovery, Relator misled the Court and Defendants, destroyed relevant evidence, and
obstructed Defendants’ investigation, including violating this Court’s Order that Relator
provide complete deposition testimony about his “receipt, use, and disclosure” of the
Privileged Documents, and refusing to produce any documents related to that subject.
Relator’s pattern of willful misconduct has denied Defendants their right to have
discovery conducted according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, violated their
attorney-client privilege, and undermined the False Claims Act and the fairness of these
proceedings.

Dismissal is the only remedy that will adequately sanction Relator’s

misconduct, cure the prejudice to Defendants, and deter such abusive litigation tactics. In the
alternative, if the Court finds that a more developed record would help it decide a suitable
sanction, Defendants ask that Relator be compelled to continue his deposition and produce the
other discovery requested by Defendants as set forth below and in their proposed order.

II.
BACKGROUND
Relator Secretly Copies Defendants’ Privileged and Other Confidential
Documents and Wrongfully Retains Them For Use in This Lawsuit
Defendant Alutiiq, LLC (“Alutiiq”) hired Relator in March 2008 as its Corporate

Industrial Security Manager. Declaration of Amy Shimek, Dkt. 77-3 (“Shimek Decl.”) ¶ 5.
Relator agreed to return Defendants’ property, including all of their files and documents,
when his employment ended. See id. ¶ 6, Exs. A-B; Decl. of Angela R. Jones in Supp. of
Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss as Sanction (“Jones Decl.”) ¶ 37, Exs. Y-Z.
In May 2011, Alutiiq promoted Relator to Chief Compliance Officer, a position in the
Legal Department reporting to the General Counsel. Shimek Decl. ¶ 5; Dep. Tr. of Ben Ferris
(“Ferris Tr.”) at 13:4-13, 17:10-12, 17:20-22, Jones Decl. ¶ 28, Ex. P. When he started using
a desktop at work, Relator bought an external hard drive and arranged for Defendants’
Information Technology Department to encrypt it so he could use it to work from home or

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-2Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 9 of 49

remote offices. Jones Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. M at 3; Ferris Tr. at 28:7-30:2, 194:5-8, 197:13-198:2.
Relator’s home computer was the only computer, aside from those belonging to Defendants,
that Relator ever used to access this hard drive. See Jones Decl. ¶ 34, Ex. V at 5.
After attending a conference in July 2012, Relator began collecting confidential
documents regarding Defendants’ supposed non-compliance with Small Business
Administration (“SBA”) regulations. See Ferris Tr. at 28:1-13, 65:6-66:5. Relator copied
these documents into a folder he created on his hard drive. Id. at 28:1-22, 65:13-21. By
March 2013, Relator had retained counsel to file a complaint against Defendants. Id. at
52:13-19, 109:22-110:24. After contacting counsel about this lawsuit, Relator searched his
Alutiiq Outlook email folders looking for documents he thought supported his claims; he
copied those documents onto the hard drive. See id. at 62:11-63:25, 66:18-68:25, 174:10-18.
Several of these documents were privileged. Jones Decl. ¶¶ 20, 27, Ex. M at 3, Ex. O at 4-5;
see Ferris Tr. at 31:9-18, 34:2-9, 48:13-17, 53:4-9, 61:17-24, 63:6-13, 76:24-77:5.
Relator filed his Complaint under seal on May 30, 2013. Dkt. 1. He continued
working for Defendants while surreptitiously collecting more documents he thought
supported his claims to use in this case. See Ferris Tr. at 79:23-80:24, 82:5-9, 86:3-8, 87:1388:4. He also shared his theory of non-compliance with other employees—without telling
them he had sued Defendants—who sent him additional privileged documents that he copied
to his hard drive. See Ferris Tr. at 43:16-25, 51:2-21, 75:6-76:3, 80:25-81:7, 84:9-17, 85:1122, 173:12-174:5; see also Dkt. 73-2 at 2. Relator himself requested and obtained legal
advice on these issues from Defendants’ General Counsel, then secretly copied the
communications with counsel to use in this case. See Ferris Tr. at 47:4-17, 58:2-59:20; see
also Dkt. 73-2 at 2. On multiple occasions (Relator does not recall how many times), Relator
reviewed the confidential documents he had copied to his drive, identified those he felt were
“good examples” of conduct substantiating his claims, and forwarded those documents to his
own counsel. Ferris Tr. at 124:2-126:5, 126:20-127:20.

-3Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 10 of 49

Relator resigned from Alutiiq in March 2014. Ferris Tr. at 12:16-22; Shimek Decl.
¶¶ 5, 13. Before leaving, he returned some documents belonging to Defendants by uploading
them from his hard drive to Defendants’ server and deleting them from the drive. Ferris Tr. at
44:15-45:22; Jones Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. M at 3. But, in violation of his contractual obligations to
Defendants, he kept more than 2,000 pages of confidential documents for use in this case,
including the Privileged Documents and roughly 20 other documents that Relator’s counsel
would later identify as potentially privileged. Ferris Tr. at 35:5-8, 53:10-18, 61:17-24, 77:1114, 82:19-83:4, 86:9-15, 88:5-13; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 7, 27, 37, Ex. E, Ex. O at 5, Exs. Y-Z.
Relator never told anyone at Alutiiq that he had copied and taken Defendants’ confidential
documents, including the Privileged Documents. Ferris Tr. at 43:6-25, 74:10-12, 82:10-13,
85:23-86:1, 89:12-90:25, 198:3-14.
Shortly after Relator resigned, the government elected not to intervene and his
complaint was unsealed in April 2014. Dkt. 14, 15. In early 2015, the parties served their
initial disclosures and document productions: Defendants on February 26, 2015, and Relator
on March 2, 2015. See Jones Decl. ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A-B. In his disclosures, Relator represented
that his 494-page production was “a copy—or a description by category and location—of all
documents . . . that plaintiff has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support
its claims.” Jones Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B at 1, 3 (emphasis added); Ferris Tr. at 143:13-144:20.
Two weeks later, on March 17, 2015, Relator provided information missing from his initial
production (i.e., audio files for which he had produced transcripts and unredacted versions of
previously produced documents), but he did not disclose that his production was incomplete
or that he possessed over 1,600 more pages of Defendants’ confidential documents that he had
not produced, including the Privileged Documents. See Jones Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C.
B.

Relator Sends Defendants’ Privileged Communications to His Attorneys, Who
Review the Communications and Delay Notifying Defendants
On March 17, 2015, a Berg & Androphy paralegal directed Relator “to send her any

case-related materials not already provided to counsel,” so counsel could prepare “for Rule 26

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-4Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 11 of 49

initial disclosures.” Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 2. Relator promptly created and sent to the
paralegal a compact disc (“CD”) containing all the documents belonging to Defendants that
he had in his possession, including all the Privileged Documents. Id.
Relator worked in the Legal Department and knew that communications between the
General Counsel and company management were protected by the attorney-client privilege.
See Ferris Tr. at 17:10-12, 73:6-74:4. Relator’s own attorneys cautioned him “early on” in the
representation that, because he worked for the General Counsel, he needed to be careful about
attorney-client privilege and should not send them privileged information. Id. at 128:1-129:1.
Despite these warnings and his own familiarity with the attorney-client privilege, Relator took
no precautions to protect potentially privileged documents while harvesting documents for use
in this case.

Id. at 129:14-130:8. Relator did not segregate the potentially privileged

documents he was collecting on the hard drive; he did not delete potentially privileged
documents from the hard drive; and he did not move potentially privileged documents into a
separate folder on the hard drive. Id. Nor did Relator do anything to protect potentially
privileged documents on the CD he sent to his counsel; he neither segregated the potentially
privileged documents nor consulted with his counsel about potentially privileged documents.
Id. at 137:12-138:17. Instead, he just copied all the privileged and confidential documents
and sent them to Berg & Androphy. Id. at 130:9-131:10; Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 2.
The Berg & Androphy paralegal received the CD on March 19, 2015. She then
transferred the documents to a flash drive that she sent on to Price Armstrong, another law
firm representing Relator. Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 2-3. Price Armstrong attorneys received
the flash drive a week later and set about reviewing Defendants’ confidential and Privileged
Documents “in full.” Id. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 3. At no point during their review did Relator’s
counsel notify Defendants that Relator had sent them potentially privileged documents. See
id. ¶ 8. Nor is there any evidence that Relator’s counsel took any precautions to prevent the
review of privileged documents, despite knowing that Relator worked in Defendants’ Legal

Department and had access to privileged documents. Id. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 2-6; Ferris Tr. at
128:1-129:1.
On June 8, 2015, Relator’s counsel sent proposed custodians and search terms for an
email review to Defendants. Jones Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. D. Two proposed custodians were Linda
Reeves and Susan Hirka, and proposed search terms included “sign /15 (chang! replac! mov!
nam!),” the relevance of which will be discussed in the section below. Id.

Defendants Finally Learn Relator Possesses Privileged Documents and Seek
Discovery About His Misappropriation1
On the same day Relator circulated his proposed custodians and search terms, Relator

notified Defendants for the first time that he would produce “the remaining relevant
documents in his possession,” separated into two folders. Jones Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. E at 1.
According to Relator, one folder contained 29 “directly relevant” documents that his counsel
had reviewed and decided were not “protected from discovery” because they did not involve
legal advice and “exceptions to any privilege apply.” Id. The other folder contained 1,523
pages of Defendants’ other confidential documents. Id. ¶¶ 7, 11, Ex. E, Ex. G.
When the production arrived three days later, Defendants immediately reviewed the
1,617 pages in the production. Id. ¶¶ 9-11, Exs. F-G. The 29 documents Relator’s counsel
produced in the separate folder included an email from Susan Hirka; an email from Arlina
(Linda) Reeves; and an email from an Alutiiq paralegal instructing another employee “to
install signage within the corporate offices to identify which Alutiiq subsidiary the nearby
employees are working for.” Id. ¶ 10; Dkt. 73-4 at 3, 24, 34. Because these individuals and
terms had not appeared anywhere else, see Jones Decl. ¶ 5, it appeared that Relator’s counsel

1

Relator has objected to Defendants’ use of the term “misappropriation” to describe
his misconduct. See, e.g., Dkt. 165 at 6. “Appropriate” means “take possession of, esp.
without authority.”
Appropriate, Oxford Am. Dictionary & Thesaurus 65 (2003).
“Misappropriate” means “[t]o appropriate wrongly.” Misappropriate, Am. Heritage College
Dictionary 887 (4th ed. 2002). Relator secretly copied and retained Defendants’ documents,
including the Privileged Documents, for his use in this litigation, in violation of his
contractual obligations, and without permission. That certainly fits the definition of
misappropriation, if not something worse.

had used these “segregated” documents to draft proposed custodian and search term lists.
Of the 29 segregated documents, Defendants asserted privilege over nine, including
two memoranda from Defendants’ General Counsel to the CEO/President, one of which was
expressly marked as “Attorney-Client Privileged” and “Confidential & Proprietary.” See
Jones Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. G; Dkt. 73-2 at 19. 2 Defendants demanded that Relator return the
documents, requested information about his and his attorneys’ access, use, storage, review,
transfer, and disclosure of the documents, and asked him to appear for a deposition on these
issues.

See Jones Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. G.

But Relator’s response provided only partial

information. Id. ¶¶ 12-13, Exs. H-I. And only after Defendants asked Relator and his counsel
to immediately destroy the Privileged Documents did Relator and his counsel represent
(incorrectly) that they had done so. Id. ¶ 15, Ex. K.
Because Relator’s initial responses were evasive and incomplete, Defendants served
interrogatories seeking basic information about Relator’s and his counsel’s access, use,
storage, review, transfer, and disclosure of the Privileged Documents. See id. ¶ 14, Ex. J.
After agreeing to notify Defendants by June 29 whether they would expeditiously respond to
the interrogatories, Relator failed to do so and instead moved to compel production of the
Privileged Documents. Jones Decl. ¶¶ 16-17, Ex. L; Dkt. 73. Because Relator still had not
responded to Defendants’ interrogatories, on July 2, Defendants moved to compel Relator to
respond and to appear for a deposition.

Dkt. 77.

Relator finally served incomplete

interrogatory responses on July 6, but refused to provide any further information, claiming the
missing information was irrelevant and protected by work product or privilege. Jones Decl.
¶¶ 20-21, Exs. M-N. Relator also refused to appear for the requested deposition. Dkt. 85 at 3.
After the parties’ discovery motions were fully briefed, the case was transferred to this
Court. Dkt. 104. Two of the law firms representing Relator then withdrew: Price Armstrong

The nine Privileged Documents were reviewed in camera by the Court, see Dkt. 199
(Order), and were described in Defendants’ prior filings with the Court. See Dkt. 77-3.

and Frohsin & Barger. Dkt. 119. On October 5, 2015, this Court denied the parties’ pending
motions to compel with leave to renew, expressly noting “the potential need for supplemental
briefing” on the motions. Dkt. 122 at 3.
The parties filed that supplemental briefing, renewing their motions to compel, on
April 22, 2016. Dkt. 150, 152. In September 2016, this Court held that the Privileged
Documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege and denied Relator’s motion to
compel their production. See Dkts. 180, 199. Despite Relator’s objections that Defendants’
motion to compel further discovery was “moot,” “improper,” and “a calculated distraction,”
Dkt. 165 at 5-6, the Court granted Defendants’ motion and ordered Relator to provide more
complete interrogatory responses and to appear for a deposition regarding the receipt, use, and
disclosure of the Privileged Documents. Dkt. 199 at 13-14.
D.

The Court-Ordered Discovery Shows Relator’s Misappropriation and Cover-Up
Relator served the supplemental interrogatory responses ordered by the Court on

October 5, 2016. Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O. Relator appeared for the Court-ordered deposition
on November 2, 2016.

Id. ¶ 28.

Defendants then served Requests for Production of

Documents on Relator, seeking documents related to the taking, use, and transfer of the
Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential documents.

Id. ¶ 32, Ex. T.

Relator’s responses and deposition testimony make clear that he has engaged, and continues
to engage, in a concerted effort to conceal the full extent of his misconduct.
1.

Discovery Reveals that Relator Misled the Court and Defendants

To avoid discovery, Relator represented to Defendants and the Court that: (1) he
acquired the Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential documents “during the
ordinary course of his employment”; (2) he and his attorneys never used the Privileged
Documents “at any time,” “in any way,” or “for any purpose”; (3) his attorneys promptly
segregated the Privileged Documents and produced them to Defendants “immediately” after
learning of them; and (4) he and his attorneys destroyed all copies of the Privileged
Documents at Defendants’ request. See Dkt. 85 at 1, 4-5, 7-8; Dkt. 85-1 at 7, 14, 16-17; Dkt.
United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-8Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 15 of 49

165 at 3.
The discovery ordered by the Court shows all these representations were false.
Relator did not acquire the Privileged Documents “during the ordinary course of his
employment”; he now admits he covertly copied them specifically to use against Defendants
in this case, after talking with his counsel, and following a comprehensive search of his
Alutiiq Outlook email folders for documents he thought supported his claims. Ferris Tr. at
62:6-63:25, 72:22-73:1, 76:24-77:14, 82:5-9, 86:3-15, 87:23-88:13, 89:15-25.
Although Relator unequivocally assured the Court and Defendants that he personally
never used or relied on the Privileged Documents for any purpose, Dkt. 85 at 3; Dkt. 85-1 at
16, 17, his sworn testimony was hedged with professions of uncertainty and lack of
recollection. Relator testified that he “probably” accessed at least some of the Privileged
Documents after he consulted with counsel about this case, possibly to refresh his
recollection, Ferris Tr. at 35:9-36:22, 49:11-50:162:11-63:25, 66:18-68:25; he could not recall
how many times he did so, including whether it was once or more than ten times, id. at 35:222; he “probably” reviewed at least some of the Privileged Documents and knew their
contents before the Complaint was filed, id. at 135:25-136:18; and he accessed documents
from the hard drive and transferred them to his attorneys on an unknown number of
occasions, id. at 126:3-127:20, 174:10-175:25.
Contrary to Relator’s claims, his attorneys did not “immediately” produce the
Privileged Documents to Defendants. Dkt. 85-1 at 7. In fact, they received the Privileged
Documents from Relator no later than March 19, 2015, but failed to notify Defendants until
June 8, 2015—meaning that they had the documents in their possession for more than two
months without any disclosure to Defendants. Jones Decl. ¶¶ 8-9, 27, Ex. O.
Discovery also showed Relator’s representations about his counsel’s receipt and use of
the Privileged Documents to be false. Relator specifically represented that Price Armstrong
did not use the Privileged Documents “in the litigation” and that Berg & Androphy never

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-9Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 16 of 49

received the Privileged Documents from Relator, never possessed them, and never had them
in its case file. Dkt. 165 at 5. In fact, Relator now admits that Price Armstrong reviewed all
the confidential documents taken by Relator from Defendants “in full,” and they accessed the
Privileged Documents in particular “to prepare initial disclosures” and “in preparing to
challenge any assertion of privilege.” See Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O at 3, 5. The evidence
suggests that they also used the documents to develop discovery strategy, to identify
witnesses, and to identify search terms and parameters for electronic discovery. See id. ¶¶ 56, Ex. D; supra section II.C. Further, Relator now admits he sent the Privileged Documents to
Berg & Androphy on a CD in March 2015, that a Berg & Androphy paralegal transferred the
documents from the CD to a flash drive (purportedly “without reviewing them in any detail”),
then sent the flash drive to Price Armstrong for more detailed review, and that Berg &
Androphy possessed the CD for more than three months, until June 24, 2015. Jones Decl.
¶ 27, Ex. O at 2-3.
Even Relator’s repeated assurances that he and his attorneys destroyed all the
Privileged Documents turned out to be incorrect. See Dkt. 165 at 3; Dkt. 85 at 2; Dkt. 85-1 at
14. Relator’s counsel later informed Defendants that one of the Privileged Documents, in
fact, had not been destroyed. See Jones Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. S. Instead, the document was
uploaded to an “FTP” site and then distributed to at least three of the firms now representing
Relator: Berg & Androphy, Motley Rice, and the Rabon Law Firm. Id. Although Relator’s
counsel learned of their continued possession of the document on the day before Relator’s
deposition, they did not advise Defendants of that fact until more than a week after the
deposition. Id.
2.

Relator Reveals that He and His Counsel Destroyed Evidence

Not only has discovery shown that Relator misled the Court and Defendants, it also
shows that Relator has spoliated relevant evidence.

Most importantly, Relator recently

disclosed that in December 2015, two months after this Court noted the “potential need for

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-10Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 17 of 49

supplemental briefing” on Defendants’ motion to compel evidence regarding Relator’s access
to and use of the Privileged Documents, Relator threw away his home computer—the only
computer except Defendants’ computers that he used to access his hard drive—“dispos[ing]
of [it] with other trash.” Jones Decl. ¶ 34, Ex. V at 5 (emphasis added). Relator did not
disclose this spoliation until December 19, 2016, more than 12 months after it occurred. Id.
Among other things, Relator did not disclose this spoliation in any of his filings with this
Court, in his Court-ordered supplemental interrogatory responses, or in his Court-ordered
deposition.
In addition to trashing his home computer, Relator also deleted the entire folder on his
hard drive where he copied, stored, and accessed the Privileged Documents and other
confidential documents using the now-destroyed home computer. See Ferris Tr. at 131:16132:3, 154:25-157:6. This includes the more than two thousand pages of non-privileged
confidential documents he took from Defendants, plus the entire folder structure of the hard
drive, which, according to Relator’s own testimony, memorialized which documents he sent
to his counsel. Id. at 123:9-126:5, 131:16-132:3.
For their part, Relator’s counsel also lost or destroyed the media used to store and
transfer the Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential documents. In a telling
use of the passive voice, Relator’s counsel informed Defendants that the flash drive used to
transfer the Privileged Documents and other confidential documents between law firms could
“no longer be identified.” Jones Decl. ¶ 34, Ex. V at 7. The Berg & Androphy computer to
which the flash drive was connected “had its . . . hard drive replaced by the firm’s IT vendor,”
and “returned under warranty to Dell.” Id. And although Price Armstrong had reviewed and
used the Privileged Documents and other confidential documents, neither Relator nor his
other counsel apparently took any steps to preserve Price Armstrong’s records—and the firm
reportedly destroyed all of its files regarding this case after it was transferred to this Court and
while Defendants’ motion to compel discovery was pending. Id. ¶ 31, Ex. S at 1.

Relator Stonewalls His Court-Ordered Deposition and Refuses to Produce
Any Related Documents

Even after the Court ordered Relator to supplement his discovery responses and
appear for deposition, Dkt. 199, Relator has continued to obstruct discovery into his
misconduct. Despite the Court’s Order compelling Relator to testify about his “receipt, use,
and disclosure” of the Privileged Documents, Relator repeatedly refused to answer questions
at his deposition about those topics. Sixty-four times, Relator refused to answer Defendants’
questions about relevant topics, including (1) what computers or other devices Relator used
for work purposes, Ferris Tr. at 25:22-26:14; (2) what email address(es) Relator used to
transmit documents to his attorneys, id. at 23:11-23, 176:10-177:1; (3) how Relator chose
what documents to copy, id. at 33:9-17; (4) whether Relator asked his attorneys about
transferring Defendants’ privileged communications, id. at 69:2-25, 70:9-14, 74:14-23;
(5) whether Relator’s taking of the Privileged Documents violated his contractual obligations
or Alutiiq’s policies, id. at 91:23-92:16, 93:14-95:16, 103:4-104:16, 105:18-108:8; and
(6) whether Relator used the copied documents for various purposes, such as to determine
whether the qui tam complaint was accurate, to select exhibits to the complaint, or to provide
documents to the Department of Justice, id. at 117:13-22, 119:11-120:11, 121:9-122:19.
Those questions were directly relevant to Relator’s receipt, use, and disclosure of the
Privileged Documents; indeed, in many cases they related to Relator’s own assertions in his
supplemental interrogatory responses, such as his claims that he never used the Privileged
Documents, the details of his disclosure and transfer of the Privileged Documents to his
attorneys, and his multiple assertions that his lawyers never used the documents. See Jones
Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. M; Dkt. 85, 165. Relator’s counsel further stymied much of the questioning
through a combination of lengthy speaking objections3 and coaching the witness.4 Defendants

Relator also flatly refused to produce any responsive documents or physical evidence
regarding his taking, use, and disclosure of the confidential documents in response to
Defendants’ Requests for Production. Id. ¶ 34, Ex. V. These include: (1) the hard drive to
which Relator copied the documents and where they were stored; (2) identification of the
personal email account he used to send Defendants’ documents to his counsel; (3) the device
installation log from Price Armstrong’s computer, showing when and how often they accessed
the flash drive; and (4) communications with or among Relator and/or his attorneys regarding
the Privileged Documents. Although Relator withheld many of the requests on grounds of
privilege, Relator refused to produce a privilege log. Id. ¶ 36, Ex. X.5

AUTHORITY
Relator’s Unfair and Abusive Litigation Tactics Call for Dismissal
The Court has the inherent power to dismiss a case to redress abusive litigation

practices and ensure the orderly administration of justice. See Halaco Eng’g Co. v. Costle,
843 F.2d 376, 380 (9th Cir. 1988). For dismissal to be proper, the misconduct must be “due
to willfulness, fault, or bad faith” and must be related to “the matters in controversy.”

Counsel for Defendants and Relator met and conferred today regarding this motion.
Relator continued to refuse to produce any documents or items in response to Defendants’
Second Requests for Production. See Jones Decl. ¶¶ 38-40. Relator did offer for the first time
to consider providing a limited privilege log identifying the communications between or
among Relator and/or his counsel regarding Defendants’ Privileged Documents. Id. Given
that Relator’s and his counsel’s use, access to, and disclosure of, Defendants’ confidential and
privileged documents is relevant, Defendants are entitled to a more fulsome log listing all
responsive documents withheld under a claim of privilege. But more importantly, Relator still
refuses to produce any of the requested communications themselves.
In the same meeting, Relator also informed Defendants that he intends to produce
additional documents. Id. As of this filing, Defendants have not received those documents.
Id. Defendants may supplement the record to the extent Relator provides additional
documents relevant to this motion.

dismissing a claim or defense). If those threshold criteria are met, the Court must consider
five factors before exercising its inherent power to dismiss: “(1) the public’s interest in
expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court’s need to manage its dockets; (3) the risk of
prejudice to the party seeking sanctions; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on
their merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions.” Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 69 F.3d
at 348. These factors “provide[] the district court with a way to think about what to do, not a
set of conditions precedent for sanctions or a script that the district court must follow.” Conn.
Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 482 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2007).
Because the first two factors “generally favor the imposition of sanctions, and the fourth
factor cautions against dismissal, ‘the key factors are prejudice and the availability of lesser
sanctions.’” Jackson v. Microsoft Corp., 211 F.R.D. 423, 431 (W.D. Wash. 2002) (quoting
Wanderer v. Johnston, 910 F.2d 652, 656 (9th Cir. 1990)).
Dismissal is appropriate when a litigant wrongfully obtains another party’s privileged
and other confidential documents for use in litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Quest
Diagnostics Inc., 734 F.3d 154, 167 (2d Cir. 2013) (affirming dismissal without prejudice to
the United States when qui tam relator relied on privileged and confidential information
supplied by former in-house counsel to pursue claims under the False Claims Act); Xyngular

confidential, and possibly privileged documents from another employee in anticipation of
litigation), appeal filed, No. 16-4193 (10th Cir. Nov. 4, 2016); Jackson, 211 F.R.D. at 431-33
(dismissing plaintiff’s claims when he stole or purchased defendant’s email messages
containing confidential and privileged information); Perna v. Elec. Data Sys., Corp., 916 F.
Supp. 388, 398 (D.N.J. 1995) (dismissing plaintiff’s individual claims because he
surreptitiously reviewed and photocopied defendant’s privileged documents). Moreover, the
Court “may properly consider all of a party’s discovery misconduct in weighing a motion to

dismiss.” Payne v. Exxon Corp., 121 F.3d 503, 508 (9th Cir. 1997).
For example, in Jackson v. Microsoft, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s lawsuit
against his former employer because of the plaintiff’s discovery abuses, which included
obtaining proprietary materials from his employer and then lying to the court about it. Shortly
before leaving Microsoft’s employment, and without Microsoft’s permission, the plaintiff
took emails, including privileged communications, as well as other proprietary and
confidential information, which he transferred to his hard drive and accessed extensively. 211
F.R.D. at 426, 431. He then “intentionally removed and destroyed those portions of the emails which would identify the person who printed the document from an electronic format.”
Id. at 426. The plaintiff also “told an ever more elaborate series of lies about his misconduct.”
See id. at 431-32. The court found that dismissal was appropriate based on the plaintiff’s
“conduct in obtaining (and in some cases altering) this vast quantity of Microsoft’s data,” and
his “secretive behavior and clear reliance on the stolen documents in the preparation of his
case.” Id. Dismissal was also required because “Jackson’s astonishing pattern of deceptive
acts and fraudulent testimony” had “undermined the truth-finding function of the Court
beyond repair.” Id.
Many parallels exist between the plaintiff’s conduct in Jackson and Relator’s conduct.
In this case, Relator engaged in the following misconduct: (1) misappropriated the Privileged
Documents and other confidential documents in plain breach of his contractual obligations
and contrary to Defendants’ policies; (2) failed to take any steps to segregate or protect the
Privileged Documents; (3) shared the Privileged Documents and other confidential documents
with his attorneys despite being cautioned not to share privileged communications; (4) used
the Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential communications for strategic
purposes in this litigation; (5) delayed notifying Defendants that he and his counsel possessed
Defendants’ privileged communications; (6) obstructed Defendants’ attempts to discover
relevant information about Relator’s and his counsel’s receipt, access, and use of the

Privileged Documents; (7) misled the Court and Defendants about his misconduct; and
(8) intentionally destroyed evidence knowing full well it was relevant. Relator’s misconduct
was willful and in bad faith.

It was directly related to the matters in controversy.

It

prejudiced Defendants. Lesser sanctions are insufficient. And it shows Relator is manifestly
unfit for the extraordinary privileges and responsibilities of litigating claims on behalf of the
United States under the False Claims Act. For these reasons, the Court should dismiss
Relator’s claims.
1.

Relator Engaged in a Pattern of Willful Misconduct

The facts described above show no accident, but a pattern of willful misconduct.
a.

Relator Willfully Misappropriated Defendants’ Privileged and
Other Confidential Documents and Shared Them with His
Attorneys

Relator’s misconduct began when he deliberately and surreptitiously copied
Defendants’ privileged and other confidential documents for the purpose of supporting his
claims in this case. He made no effort to protect Defendants’ privileged information, despite
his position in the Legal Department and his understanding that communications with
Defendants’ General Counsel could be subject to attorney-client privilege. Relator was well
aware of procedures that can be used to protect sensitive information; after all, part of his role
was to oversee and manage Defendants’ classified information policies, and to supervise
Defendants’ Industrial Security Program. See Ferris Tr. at 15:19-16:13. Yet he employed no
such precautions while he secretly collected and copied documents to support his claims
against Defendants—including communications with the General Counsel and one expressly
marked “ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED.” See, e.g., Eagle Hosp. Physicians, LLC v.
SRG Consulting, Inc., 561 F.3d 1298, 1306 (11th Cir. 2009) (finding bad faith where, as “a
doctor and a frequent litigator,” the defendant “would be familiar with the notion of privileged
information and would know that he should not be intercepting confidential emails”); Perna,
916 F. Supp. at 399 (plaintiff “knew his conduct was wrong” partly because he was “a
sophisticated businessman” who was “not a stranger to the litigation arena”).

-16Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 23 of 49

Relator then deliberately breached his contractual obligations to Defendants by
retaining their confidential and privileged documents after his employment terminated: he
uploaded and deleted those of Defendants’ documents that he “thought might be of value to
the Defendants,” but retained the documents he felt “supported the case.” Jones Decl. ¶ 20,
Ex. M at 3; see, e.g., Ferris Tr. at 53:4-18. Such actions are improper. “Parties anticipating
litigation may not engage in self-help by improperly gathering a potential adversary’s
property,” Xyngular, 2016 WL 412462 at *36, yet that is what Relator did when he retained
those of Defendants’ privileged and confidential documents that he felt supported his claims.
See also JDS Uniphase Corp. v. Jennings, 473 F. Supp. 2d 697, 702 (E.D. Va. 2007) (public
policy in favor of whistle-blowing cannot “fairly be said to authorize disgruntled employees
to pilfer a wheelbarrow full of an employer’s proprietary documents in violation of their
contract merely because it might help them blow the whistle on an employer’s violations of
law, real or imagined”).
Finally, despite his own familiarity with the attorney-client privilege and his counsel’s
cautions about privileged documents, Relator took no precautions to safeguard Defendants’
privileged communications, and ultimately sent his attorneys all the confidential documents
he had covertly collected, including the Privileged Documents. Acting in the face of an
instruction not to do so is paradigmatic evidence of intentional misconduct undertaken in bad
faith. See, e.g., Maldonado v. New Jersey ex rel. Admin. Office of Courts-Probation Div., 225
F.R.D. 120, 135 (D.N.J. 2004) (declining to find bad faith when plaintiff provided privileged
letter to his attorney because “there was seemingly client ignorance,” but noting its
appropriateness if “there was a knowing and deliberate client”).
Relator’s status as a relator “does not shield his bad faith conduct.” Xyngular, 2016
WL 4126462, at *37, *42 (although “[w]histleblowers certainly are entitled to a number of
protections,” it would “swing[] the pendulum too far” to “giv[e] them far-reaching access to
their litigation opponent’s property”); see also United States ex rel. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics

they instructed Relator not to disclose to them privileged information. His disregard for this
instruction, his surreptitious self-help discovery, and his unlawful retention of Defendants’
documents all establish his willful misconduct and bad faith.
b.

Relator and His Counsel Willfully Accessed and Used Defendants’
Privileged Documents in This Litigation

The evidence shows that Relator willfully accessed and used the Privileged
Documents (and the other confidential documents) in this lawsuit.
Relator admits that he copied and retained the Privileged Documents with the express
intent to use them to support his claims against Defendants in this lawsuit. He admits that he
repeatedly sifted through Defendants’ confidential documents on his hard drive (where the
Privileged Documents were commingled with other confidential documents), identified those
he thought were particularly helpful, and sent them to his attorneys. Ferris Tr. 124:2-25,
127:1-16. Although Relator said he could not recall when or how often he accessed the
Privileged Documents in particular—and he destroyed evidence that would have allowed
Defendants to obtain that information forensically—he admitted that he probably did so on
some occasions, see, e.g., Ferris Tr. at 35:9-22; 48:24-50:1, and it would defy credulity to
think he never did so, given that he took Defendants’ confidential documents expressly for
this purpose and made no efforts to segregate potentially privileged documents. See, e.g.,
Lipin v. Bender, 644 N.E.2d 1300, 1300 (N.Y. 1994) (affirming dismissal as sanction for
plaintiff’s “taking and use of the adversary’s privileged documents”).

-18Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 25 of 49

In any event, Relator certainly did send the Privileged Documents to his attorneys in
March 2015, contrary to his attorneys’ instructions and without taking any precautions to
protect Defendants’ privileged communications. And it is undisputed that his attorneys then
reviewed the documents and used them in this lawsuit—including the Privileged Documents.
In particular, Relator now admits that his attorneys received the documents from Relator,
including the Privileged Documents, retained them for two months, reviewed them “in full,”
and in the process of reviewing them divided them into categories, including a “segregated”
sub-set of documents they recognized Defendants would likely argue were privileged.
Moreover, while in possession of the Privileged Documents, Relator’s attorneys admittedly
used them, “access[ing] the nine [Privileged Documents] after receiving them to prepare
initial disclosures, and in preparing to challenge any assertion of privilege.” Jones Decl.
¶ 27, Ex. O at 5 (emphasis added). This admission is especially damning, as a party’s initial
disclosures identify the evidence that a party may use to support its claims or defenses,
including witnesses and documents. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A). At minimum, then,
Relator admits that his attorneys used the Privileged Documents that he sent to them to
identify the evidence that Relator would use to support his claims.6
That conduct was improper. A lawyer has an obligation to take reasonable steps to
avoid reviewing an opposing party’s privileged communications, especially where the lawyer
is on notice that the lawyer’s client may have misappropriated such documents. See Richards
v. Jain, 168 F. Supp. 2d 1195, 1200-02 (W.D. Wash. 2001). “[I]f any question ar[ises]” as to
whether documents may be privileged, attorneys and their legal staff must immediately “cease
reviewing documents.” Id. at 1202. In addition to “refrain[ing] from further examination,”
attorneys should “immediately return” the apparently privileged documents to the holder of

6

It is unclear exactly how Relator’s counsel used the Privileged Documents to prepare
initial disclosures two weeks after they were served: the admission raises more questions than
it answers. Perhaps they meant to supplement rather than prepare the initial disclosures?
Perhaps some other use? Relator had no answers. Ferris Tr. at 150:18-154:12.

the privilege. Furnish v. Merlo, No. 93-1052-AS, 1994 WL 574137, at *9 (D. Or. Aug. 29,
1994); see also Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 60 cmt. m (2000) (“if
the receiving lawyer is aware that disclosure” of an opposing party’s confidential information
was “made in breach of trust by a lawyer or other agent of the opposing person, the receiving
lawyer must not accept the information”).
Instead, Relator and his attorneys—well aware of Relator’s position in Defendants’
Legal Department and their obligation not to use an opponent’s privileged documents—
apparently failed to employ any precautions or make any effort to prevent the review of
potentially privileged documents.

Such omissions are “a failure of reasonable care,

approaching recklessness.” Richards, 168 F. Supp. 2d at 1202 (castigating attorneys for
failing to inquire whether their client had privileged information and failing to ensure
privileged materials would not be reviewed).
Not only did Relator and his attorneys fail to employ any measures to guard against
the review and use of Defendants’ privileged communications, they violated their obligations
yet again once they identified the Privileged Documents because they retained the documents,
continued their review, and failed to immediately notify Defendants. See Gifford v. Target
Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (D. Minn. 2010) (disqualifying law firm representing
plaintiff because it retained privileged documents “for more than a month” instead of “ceasing
its review, immediately informing [defendant] it was in possession of the privileged
documents, and returning the documents”). A unilateral determination of privilege does not
excuse their conduct. See, e.g., Gomez v. Vernon, 255 F.3d 1118, 1134 (9th Cir. 2001)
(rejecting argument that counsel could retain and review opposing parties’ privileged
communications because counsel believed the opposing parties had waived any applicable
privilege); Arnold v. Cargill Inc., No. 01-2086 (DWF/AJB), 2004 WL 2203410, at *10 (D.
Minn. Sept. 24, 2004) (an attorney is prohibited “from conducting his or her own privilege
review of documents belonging to a corporation he or she is preparing to sue”); Furnish, 1994

WL 574137, at *9 (attorney’s retention of defendant’s privileged memorandum surreptitiously
obtained by the plaintiff was “inexcusable” even if “the asserted attorney-client privilege may
not have attached to the . . . memo, or may have been waived”).
And most egregiously, not only did Relator and his attorneys continue to possess
Defendants’ Privileged Documents, Relator admits that his attorneys used them against
Defendants in this lawsuit. Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O, at 5. And the evidence strongly suggests
that Relator’s attorneys likely relied on the Privileged Documents even more extensively than
Relator has admitted, including to develop discovery strategy, such as identifying email
custodians and search terms. Relator’s counsel segregated 29 of the documents Relator
provided into a separate folder, treating all documents in that folder as equivalent. See Dkt 97
at 7; Dkt. 150 at 10 (arguing that if the nine contested documents were privileged, then the
other documents segregated by Relator’s counsel “would necessarily be privileged as well”).
Relator’s counsel must have relied on the segregated documents to draft proposed search term
and custodian lists: how else would they have identified Susan Hirka and Linda Reeves, or
come up with the far-removed “sign” search term? See supra section II.C. Because the
record shows Relator and his counsel used documents they believed to be potentially
privileged, it would be incredible to believe that they happened to avoid reviewing the very
documents this Court ultimately determined to be privileged. But even without that additional
evidence, Relator’s own admissions show that he and his counsel willfully and improperly
accessed and used Defendants’ Privileged Documents in this lawsuit.
c.

Relator Sought to Cover Up His Misconduct by Misrepresenting
Facts to Defendants and the Court and Obstructing Discovery

In seeking to avoid discovery into his receipt, use, and disclosure of the Privileged
Documents, Relator assured the Court that Defendants were making much ado about nothing.
Dkt. 165 at 4 (no breach and no harm). He mocked Defendants for creating “such drama,”
and even scolded Defendants for their “disappointing behavior” in not accepting “the solemn
representation[s] of [a] fact” made by Relator’s counsel. Id. at 3-4.

-21Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 28 of 49

But virtually all Relator’s representations and assurances were false. Relator did not
copy the Privileged Documents to his hard drive “with the consent of the company” or
“during the ordinary course of his employment” as he told the Court and Defendants. Dkt.
165 at 3; Dkt. 85 at 1; Dkt. 85-2 at 3. Rather, after talking with his attorneys about this
lawsuit, Relator covertly searched for and copied those documents to an external hard drive
for the purpose of supporting his claims in this case and retained them without Defendants’
consent.
Relator’s deposition testimony also did not support his prior unequivocal statements
that he had never used the Privileged Documents “for any purpose.” Dkt. 165 at 3; Dkt. 85-1
at 16, 17. Under oath, Relator hedged about using the Privileged Documents, admitting he
“probably” accessed and reviewed at least some of them after contacting counsel about this
case, possibly to refresh his recollection. Ferris Tr. at 35:9-36:22, 49:11-50, 62:11-63:25,
66:18-68:25. And even Relator’s repeated assurance that he and his attorneys destroyed all
the Privileged Documents was incorrect:

in June 2015, Price Armstrong (purportedly

inadvertently) uploaded one privileged communication to an FTP site and distributed the link
to Relator’s other law firms, which downloaded it and retained it until November 2016. See
Dkt. 165 at 3; Dkt. 85 at 2; Dkt. 85-1 at 14; Jones Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. S.
Most troubling, Relator misrepresented his attorneys’ handling of the Privileged
Documents, telling the Court his attorneys did not use the documents, but promptly
segregated them and “immediately” produced them to Defendants. Dkt. 85-1 at 7, 16, 17; see
also Dkt. 85 at 7. Relator even called out his law firms by name. Price Armstrong, he said,
did not use the Privileged Documents “in the litigation.” Dkt. 165 at 5. And Berg &
Androphy, he said, never received the Privileged Documents from Relator, never possessed
them, and never had them in its case file. Id.
All false. Relator’s attorneys possessed the Privileged Documents for more than two
months without any disclosure to Defendants, reviewed the Privileged Documents “in full,”

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-22Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 29 of 49

and used the Privileged Documents at least to prepare Relator’s initial disclosures and to
prepare to challenge the privilege claims that they knew were coming—contrary to Relator’s
prior claims that his attorneys never used the Privileged Documents in this litigation “at any
time,” “in any way,” or “for any purpose.” Dkt 85 at 4, 7; Dkt. 85-1 at 18; Dkt. 165 at 3, 5.
Relator said Berg & Androphy never received the Privileged Documents “from Relator or had
them in its case file,” Dkt. 165 at 5, but it was at Berg & Androphy’s direction that Relator
sent to Berg & Androphy the CD containing those same documents. Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O
at 2-3. And despite Relator’s representation that Berg & Androphy had “searched for the
[Privileged Documents] extensively but could not find them or any information to suggest
ever having had them,” Dkt. 165 at 5, at least one of those documents was present on Berg &
Androphy’s system even at the time Relator made this representation. See Jones Decl. ¶ 31,
Ex. S.
Finally, even after the Court ordered Relator to provide Defendants’ requested
discovery, he continued to stonewall Defendants’ investigation and provide false information.
Only a month before revealing the destruction of his home computer, Relator’s counsel
instructed him not to answer questions at his deposition about whether he used any computers
or removable devices for work purposes. See Ferris Tr. at 23:11-24:8, 25:22-26:14. When he
was willing to answer, he could not recall connecting the hard drive to his home computer and
said under oath “I didn’t do work on my home computer.” Id. at 30:10-18. By contrast, in
July 2015—before he threw away his home computer—he verified an interrogatory stating
that one of the reasons he purchased the encrypted hard drive in the first place was “to enable
him to work from home.” Jones Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. M at 3. And indeed, the month after his
deposition, he disclosed that his home computer was “the only computer to which the drive
was connected (other than computers within Defendants’ custody or control).” Id. ¶ 34, Ex.
V.
Relator’s secretive behavior and blatant disregard for the truth further evinces his

d.

Relator Willfully Spoliated Evidence

If any questions remain regarding Relator’s willfulness and bad faith, his intentional
destruction of evidence removes all doubt. The record shows that Relator and his counsel
have repeatedly destroyed evidence of his misappropriation.
Most egregious is the trashing of Relator’s home computer. In December 2015—six
months after Defendants first objected to Relator’s misappropriation of their privileged
documents, five months after Defendants filed their motion to compel, and two months after
this Court suggested supplemental briefing was needed on that motion—Relator “replaced
and disposed of [his home computer] with other trash.” Jones Decl. ¶ 34, Ex. V at 5.
Relator’s home computer was the only computer outside Defendants’ control to which he
connected his hard drive containing the Privileged Documents, yet he threw it away while the
parties were in the middle of their dispute over Defendants’ requests for evidence and
information about his misappropriation of those documents. And he never said a word about
his destruction until a year later: he threw away the computer in December 2015, but did not
inform the Court or Defendants of this destruction in motion practice about these issues in
2016, in his Court-ordered supplemental interrogatory responses served in October 2016, or at
his Court-ordered deposition in November 2016.7
Relator’s destruction of evidence did not stop there. Relator also deleted everything,
not only the Privileged Documents, from the hard drive folder where he stored Defendants’

7

Indeed, Relator refused to answer deposition questions that might have led
Defendants to discover his spoliation. See, e.g., Ferris Tr. at 25:22-26:14 (refusing to answer
questions about what computers or devices Relator used for work purposes). And when
pressed, he suggested (wrongly) that he did not access the hard drive from his home
computer. Id. at 30:7-18. Only when Defendants served specific Requests for Production
calling for information from any computer used to access the hard drive did Relator finally
admit that (1) he accessed the hard drive from his home computer; (2) his home computer was
the only computer he used to access the hard drive (other than Defendants’ computers); and
(3) Relator threw away his home computer with “other trash” in December 2015. Jones Decl.

documents. 8 Even if the parties had not been disputing Relator’s misappropriation of
Defendants’ documents, he was obliged to preserve that folder, as he had produced from it
thousands of pages he described as the documents he would use to support his claims and as
“relevant documents in his possession.” See Jones Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. E; see also Dkt. 70 at 4-5
(“[N]othing in this Stipulation shall eliminate or alter any Party’s obligation to retain native
format copies, including associated metadata, of all documents produced in this
litigation . . . .”). Given that the documents he misappropriated were the subject of a dispute,
his massive deletion can only be willful spoliation.
Spoliation occurs when “(1) the evidence in question was in the control of one party,
(2) the evidence is relevant to a claim or defense, (3) the evidence has been destroyed, and
(4) the duty to preserve the evidence was reasonably foreseeable to the party.” Shawback v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 3:11-cv-00243 JWS, 2013 WL 3306078, at *1 (D. Alaska July
1, 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). “A party’s destruction of evidence
qualifies as willful spoliation if the party has ‘some notice that the documents were potentially
relevant to the litigation before they were destroyed.’” Leon v. IDX Sys. Corp., 464 F.3d 951,
959 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., 314 F.3d 995, 1001
(9th Cir. 2002)). Here, Relator’s home computer and hard drive were entirely in his control:
he knew that he had stashed the Defendants’ documents on his hard drive, connected the drive
to his home computer, and used his home computer to access (and presumably review and
transfer) the Privileged Documents. By December 2015, Relator had been on notice for
months that evidence regarding his access to or use of the Privileged Documents was relevant
and needed to be preserved. And Relator was aware that the non-privileged documents on his
hard drive were relevant—he had said as much to Defendants. See Jones Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. E.

8

Defendants requested that Relator and his counsel destroy their copies of the
Privileged Documents. They never suggested that they destroy the 2,000 other pages of
documents that Relator misappropriated from Defendants, much less the hard drive’s entire
folder structure.
United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-25Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 32 of 49

Especially in light of his knowledge and experience regarding appropriate handling of
sensitive information, he was well aware his home computer and the hard drive contained
evidence of his use of and access to the documents he misappropriated and thus should have
been preserved. These circumstances show Relator’s spoliation was willful and undertaken
“with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in the litigation.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 37(e)(2).
In cases involving the loss of evidence, there is a spectrum of behavior and
willfulness. On the one hand is the inadvertent failure to preserve information, such as
electronically stored information subject to an automatic retention schedule. See, e.g., First
Fin. Sec., Inc. v. Freedom Equity Grp., LLC, No. 15-cv-1893-HRL, 2016 WL 5870218, at *4
(N.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2016) (declining to sanction defendant for “fail[ing] to ensure the
preservation of phone records” that defendant’s phone company “destroyed in the ordinary
course of business”). On the other hand are cases, like this one, involving the intentional
destruction of evidence. See, e.g., Internmatch v. Nxtbigthing, LLC, No. 14-cv-05438-JST,
2016 WL 491483, at *4 n.6, *10 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2016) (holding that defendants willfully
spoliated evidence with intent to deprive the other party of its use when they discarded
computers containing relevant evidence by “throw[ing] [them] in the garbage”). It is the
epitome of bad faith and willful misconduct for a party to intentionally discard his computer
“with other trash” while in the middle of discovery, indeed in the middle of a discovery
dispute about Relator’s possession and use of the Privileged Documents, which had been
accessed on that computer, and then to conceal that destruction for an entire year.
Relator’s willful destruction of his home computer and deletion of the contents of the
hard drive are his most extreme spoliation of evidence, but the spoliation in this case extends
far further than those two incidents. The flash drive that his counsel used to share the
Privileged Documents among themselves “can no longer be identified.” The hard drive of the
computer that Relator’s counsel used to load the CD Relator created that contained the

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak

-26Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 33 of 49

Privileged Documents, and to create the flash drive, has been “replaced by the firm’s IT
vendor” and “returned under warranty to Dell.” Price Armstrong, the attorneys who reviewed
the Privileged Documents “in full” and used them in this litigation, destroyed “all client
documents” after the case was transferred.

The only remaining evidence of Relator’s

counsel’s access to and use of the Privileged Documents is possibly a device installation log
from Price Armstrong’s computer, but Relator has refused to disclose whether it still exists,
let alone produce it. And the only remaining physical device associated with Relator’s
misappropriation of the Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential documents
appears to be the encrypted hard drive itself—which Relator refuses to produce.

This

extensive spoliation of evidence, on top of Relator’s other misconduct, warrants the severest
of sanctions.
2.

Relator’s Misconduct Is Closely Tied to the Matters in Controversy

Relator’s own testimony and representations establish that his misconduct is closely
connected to the matters in controversy in this case.

Relator testified that he copied

Defendants’ privileged and confidential documents for the purpose of supporting his claims in
this litigation.

See, e.g., Ferris Tr. at 53:4-17, 86:3-15.

Second, Relator has already

represented to the Court that the Privileged Documents are “indisputably relevant
documents.” Dkt. 171 at 2. While Relator may try to walk back his relevance assertion now
that the Court has rejected his argument that they are not privileged, Relator’s “own
recognition that the information would yield significant litigation advantage to [him], and
consequent disadvantage to [his] adversary, undercuts any suggestion that the documents
were immaterial.” Lipin, 644 N.E.2d at 1304. Finally, Relator’s attempted cover-up and
misrepresentations to Defendants and the Court call this entire proceeding into question, as in
Jackson v. Microsoft. The court there found that “Jackson’s astonishing pattern of deceptive
acts and fraudulent testimony” meant there could be “no assurance that a trial in this matter
would indeed be a fact-finding endeavor.” 211 F.R.D. at 431-32. Relator’s willingness to

Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-27Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 34 of 49

misappropriate and then destroy relevant evidence and misrepresent facts to the Court and
Defendants warrants the same conclusion here.
3.

Defendants Have Been Irreparably Prejudiced by Relator’s Misconduct

We start from the premise that “it is certainly prejudicial to collect an opposing party’s
critical documents without authorization and then use them in litigation to gain an unfair
advantage.” See, e.g., Xyngular, 2016 WL 4126462 at *39. That is what happened here: it is
an unfair tactical advantage to obtain secret pre-lawsuit discovery in violation of the party’s
employment agreement; it is an unfair tactical advantage to obtain privileged documents that
are exempt from discovery; it is an unfair tactical advantage to dispose of relevant evidence in
the trash; and it is most certainly an unfair tactical advantage to misrepresent the facts to the
opposing parties and to the Court in an attempt to cover up the misconduct.
a.

Relator’s Use of the Privileged Documents Prejudiced Defendants

Relator admits that his counsel accessed and used Defendants’ privileged
communications to support this litigation against Defendants. See Jones Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. O at
5 (“Nick Armstrong and Oscar Price accessed the nine [privileged] emails after receiving
them to prepare initial disclosures, and in preparing to challenge any assertion of privilege,
until they destroyed the nine emails at Defendants’ counsel’s request.”). The record suggests
that Relator’s counsel further used the “segregated” documents, which included the Privileged
Documents, to develop custodian lists, search terms, and discovery strategy. See also supra
section III.A.1.b. As a result, Relator’s access to and use of the Privileged Documents has
irreparably prejudiced Defendants. See Truckstop.net, LLC v. Sprint Corp., 547 F.3d 1065,
1068 (9th Cir. 2008) (when privileged material is inadvertently disclosed, “irreparable harm
from the disclosure . . . has already taken place”); Owens v. Office of Dist. Attorney for
Eighteenth Judicial Dist., 896 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1014 (D. Colo. 2012) (“[T]he general injury
or harm caused by the improper disclosure of material subject to the attorney-client privilege
is irreparable.”).

b.

Relator’s Spoliation of Evidence Prejudiced Defendants

Relator’s disclosure of the Privileged Documents to his counsel prejudiced
Defendants.

But here the prejudice is greater than “mere” disclosure and use of those

documents. The greater prejudice is from Relator’s spoliation of the best evidence showing
the full extent of his access to and use of the Privileged Documents, namely, his home
computer.

By destroying his home computer, Relator has prevented Defendants from

obtaining forensic evidence of his access to and use of their privileged and other confidential
documents.

See Declaration of Ashraf Massoud (“Massoud Decl.”) ¶ 18.

A computer

automatically stores data showing how a user accessed, used, and transferred files on a
connected device (such as an external hard drive), but this information was lost when Relator
threw his home computer away. Id. ¶¶ 5-9. Relator obstructed a forensic analysis of his
misappropriation by deleting the folder structure and all contents of the hard drive folder
where he stored Defendants’ confidential documents, rather than limiting his deletion to the
Privileged Documents. See id. ¶ 14. And even if Defendants are able to obtain some of the
information he deleted from the hard drive—which he refuses to produce—that information
cannot replace the digital evidence that was available only on his computer, such as data
showing when and for how long he connected the hard drive to his home computer, whether
he copied or transferred any files from the hard drive, and whether he accessed files on the
hard drive without modifying or saving them. See id. ¶¶ 10-12. Information regarding the
timing or volume of Relator’s access and use of the Privileged Documents cannot be supplied
through testimony, as Relator could not recall such information at his deposition.
Relator used the word “disposing” to describe throwing his computer away in the
middle of this case; his unilateral “disposition” prejudiced Defendants by depriving them of
the ability to investigate the extent of his access to and use of their privileged and confidential
documents. See Leon, 464 F.3d at 960 (defendant was prejudiced by plaintiff’s deletion of
files on his laptop because “there was no way of recreating the contents of [those] files”);

Internmatch, 2016 WL 491483, at *12 (plaintiffs were prejudiced when defendants discarded
the computer containing the only electronic copies of key documents because they could not
“test their claim that the documents were ‘concocted’” without using the electronic copies to
“determine the date the files were created, the history of the modifications made to the files,
and other relevant information”).

Relator’s spoliation has irreparably tainted these

proceedings to Defendants’ detriment.
c.

Relator’s Misconduct Warrants an Evidentiary Presumption that
Defendants Were Prejudiced

When one party spoliates evidence with “the intent to deprive another party of the
information’s use in the litigation,” the Court may “presume that the lost information was
unfavorable to the party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e). The victim need not prove prejudice because
the intentional spoliation itself supports “an inference that the lost information was
unfavorable to the party that intentionally destroyed it.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e), advisory
committee’s notes to 2015 amendments; see also Leon, 464 F.3d at 959 (advising skepticism
of a spoliating party’s assertions that destroyed documents are irrelevant because their nonexistence prevents their relevance from being clearly ascertained). Relator’s decision to
throw away his computer in the middle of a discovery dispute about documents he used the
computer to access, warrants a presumption that the “lost” information was unfavorable to
Relator.
The additional acts of evidence destruction committed by Relator and his counsel
further bolster the appropriateness of this presumption:

(1) Relator’s deletion of all

documents he stored in the folder he maintained for this litigation, not only the Privileged
Documents; (2) the disappearance of the flash drive used to transfer the Privileged Documents
and other confidential documents between Relator’s law firms; (3) Berg & Androphy’s failure
to preserve the hard drive of the computer used to copy the Privileged Documents and other
confidential documents from the CD to a flash drive; and (4) Price Armstrong’s decision to
delete all client data after the case was transferred to this Court, but while this discovery

dispute remained pending. See also Perna, 916 F. Supp. at 401 (noting that although “one
can never know whether there was actual prejudice” arising from plaintiff’s surreptitious
access to and review of opposing counsel’s documents, “prejudice must be presumed or at the
very least not eliminated as to the defendant”).
Finally, Relator’s misconduct has caused “great prejudice to the litigation process.”
Id. (“Our system is built on rules and procedures. Litigants who bring matters before this
court must conduct themselves in an appropriate fashion.”). This is not the first ethical lapse
by a relator in a False Claims Act case. See, e.g., Quest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 167
(upholding dismissal of False Claims Act case because allowing relators “to proceed with the
suit would allow” taint of improper use of defendant’s privileged documents “to proceed into
trial”) (citation omitted); United States ex rel. Frazier v. Iasis Healthcare Corp., 392 F. App’x
535, 538 (9th Cir. 2010) (rejecting relator’s argument that return of defendant’s documents
mooted its motion for sanctions because the argument “begs the question as to whether there
was abuse of the judicial process that tainted the proceedings before the documents were
returned”); United States ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., No. 1:13cv85-HSORHW, 2015 WL 3504525, at *10 (S.D. Miss. June 3, 2015) (where relator breached ethical
duties he owed defendant, his former client, allowing case to move forward “would greatly
prejudice [defendant] because the case would be tried on a record developed primarily
through the fruits of [relator]’s unethical conduct”).
4.

Dismissal Is the Only Effective Remedy and Will Not Prejudice the Real
Party in Interest, the United States

Sanctions for “wrongfully obtain[ing] documents outside the normal discovery
process” include “dismissal of the action, the compelled return of all documents, restrictions
regarding the use of the documents at trial, disqualification of counsel and monetary
sanctions.” Kyko Global Inc. v. Prithvi Info. Sols. Ltd., No. C13-1034 MJP, 2014 WL
2694236, at *2 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2014) (citation omitted). Here, any sanctions less
severe than dismissal would fail to effectively “punish the offending party for his

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-31Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 38 of 49

wrongdoing, remedy the prejudice to and harm suffered by the adverse party and the judicial
process, deter future litigants from engaging in similar conduct, and inspire confidence in the
integrity of the judicial process.” Xyngular, 2016 WL 4126462, at *45.
First, because Relator himself undertook the majority of misconduct in this case,
attorney disqualification “would not sufficiently deter or punish the misconduct” because
Relator “would still be able to pursue his claims.” Id. at *44; Perna, 916 F. Supp. at 402
(dismissal was an appropriate remedy because “[t]he culpable individual in the instant case is
the plaintiff himself” and he “himself must bear the consequences of his deliberate actions”).
Second, the mere return of Defendants’ documents or preclusion of their use at trial
would be toothless here. Return or deletion does not remedy the “abuse of the judicial
process that tainted the proceedings before the documents were returned” or deleted. Frazier,
392 F. App’x at 538 (citing Gomez, 255 F.3d at 1133-34). And preclusion is no remedy at all
where, as here, several of the documents are privileged, so Relator could not have used them
at trial and Relator’s counsel would never have received them in discovery. See Xyngular,
2016 WL 4126462, at *43 (“Merely excluding the documents would allow potential litigants
to circumvent the discovery process to improperly obtain evidence, use that evidence to
support their claims, and then maintain those claims even if their misconduct is uncovered.”).
Third, monetary sanctions alone “would signal that litigants can circumvent the
discovery process and still pursue their claims as long as they pay a fine.” Id. at *44; see also
Perna, 916 F. Supp. at 400 (imposing monetary sanctions alone “would be conveying a
message to litigants that money could cure one’s improper acts”). This danger is particularly
acute because the amounts sought by Relator in this action would likely dwarf any sanction,
as Relator seeks treble damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act for his claims,
which he asserts implicate “every invoice” Defendants submitted to the government,
presumably for many years. See Dkt. 202 (Second Amended Complaint) at 46; Dkt. 142 at 2.
Finally, the United States is the real party in interest. Dismissing Relator’s complaint

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-32Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 39 of 49

does not preclude these claims from being litigated if the real party in interest wishes to do so.
See, e.g., Quest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 167 (dismissal was appropriate in False Claims Act
qui tam action in part because relator was “not the real party in interest” and the government
was not precluded from bringing suit).

Accordingly, “the social interests in allowing

[Relator] to continue to participat[e] in this case are minimal.” Holmes, 2015 WL 3504525, at
*10. Because Defendants seek dismissal of Relator’s Complaint without prejudice to the
United States, granting that relief appropriately sanctions Relator’s conduct without depriving
the government of its ability to litigate its case and obtain a determination on the merits.
5.

Relator’s Misconduct Shows that He Should Not Be Allowed to Represent
the Government as a Qui Tam Relator

This case involves an additional consideration favoring dismissal: Relator’s role as a
qui tam relator. Under the False Claims Act, a relator occupies a privileged position as the
representative of the United States government, which is the real party in interest. A relator is
permitted to assert claims belonging to the government, conduct the litigation on behalf of the
government, act for the government’s benefit, and share in any award.

See 31 U.S.C.

§ 3730(b)-(d). A relator enjoys procedural advantages, such as filing his or her claims under
seal—meaning a defendant has no way to protect itself from a rapacious relator prior to the
unsealing and service of the complaint. See id. § 3730(b). And a successful relator benefits
from some of the most potent remedies and punitive sanctions available under civil law,
including treble damages and civil penalties. See id. § 3729(a).
Relator’s misconduct in this case is utterly incompatible with his privileged position of
trust and responsibility. No government lawyer would be allowed to (1) misappropriate a
defendant’s confidential documents, much less privileged communications between a
defendant’s general counsel and its senior management; (2) use misappropriated privileged
and confidential documents against a defendant in litigation; (3) mislead the court and the
defendants; (4) spoliate evidence; and (5) obstruct discovery about the misconduct. Any one
of those actions would be grounds for severe sanctions; engaging in all of them would be

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-33Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 40 of 49

beyond the pale. So too for Relator: his misconduct cannot be squared with the awesome
privileges that come with standing in the shoes of the United States. See United States ex rel.
Hartpence v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., Nos. CV 08-1885-GHK (AGRx), CV 08-6403-GHK
(ARGx), 2013 WL 2278122, at *2-3 & n.2 (C.D. Cal. May 20, 2013) (disqualifying relator’s
counsel for failing to contact the court or defendant’s counsel regarding their receipt of
defendant’s privileged documents from relator and using defendant’s privileged documents in
qui tam litigation); Frazier, 2012 WL 130332, at *15 (holding that “Qui Tam Counsel did
engage in misconduct by withholding [defendant’s privileged] documents and failing to seek
either a court ruling while the case was sealed or failing to contact [defendant’s counsel] after
the seal was lifted”).
Relator’s misconduct also undermines the False Claims Act itself. In the False Claims
Act, Congress established a lawful mechanism for the government to obtain documents and
other evidence from a defendant prior to the unsealing of a complaint, namely, the civil
investigative demand (“CID”). See 31 U.S.C. § 3733. Congress laid out detailed rules
governing CIDs, specifying who may issue a CID; the required contents; service and
enforcement; and the use, return, and disclosure of any evidence obtained. Id. Congress put
specific limits on CIDs, including identifying classes of protected materials (including
privilege) and exempting information obtained through a CID from disclosure under FOIA.
Id. § 3733(d), (k). By misappropriating and using Defendant’s confidential and Privileged
Documents, Relator undermined and frustrated the False Claims Act itself. Why have such
extensive rules and protections for CIDs, if Relator can circumvent them simply by helping
himself to thousands of pages of Defendants’ confidential documents, including privileged
communications?
For all of these reasons, no sanction short of dismissal will effectively cleanse this
proceeding of the taint Relator has already visited upon it. See Xyngular, 2016 WL 4126462,
at *45. Defendants therefore ask this Court to dismiss the case with prejudice as to Relator.

B.

In the Alternative, Relator Should Be Compelled to Produce Additional
Discovery
The record of Relator’s conduct over the past four years warrants dismissal. But if the

Court believes an even more developed factual record is appropriate, Defendants request that
Relator be compelled to continue his first deposition (without prejudice to a subsequent
deposition) and to produce whatever evidence remains after Relator’s spoliation that is
responsive to Defendants’ Second Set of Requests for Production (“Requests”).
1.

Relator Should Be Compelled to Continue His Deposition

Despite this Court’s Order compelling Relator to testify regarding the receipt, use, and
disclosure of the Privileged Documents, Relator repeatedly (64 times) refused to answer
questions directly relevant to those topics. See Jones Decl. ¶¶ 29, 33, Exs. R, U. For
example, Relator attempted to artificially cabin the scope of the deposition to encompass only
questions that directly referred to one of the Privileged Documents. See, e.g., Ferris Tr. at
122:24-123:1. But because Relator’s own testimony establishes that he commingled the
Privileged Documents with the other confidential documents that he misappropriated, see id.
at 129:14-130:8, his access and use of the misappropriated confidential documents speaks to
his access and use of the Privileged Documents as well. Other questions Relator refused to
answer directly sought to probe matters raised in his answers to Defendants’ Second Set of
Interrogatories; for example, questions about whether he knowingly violated his contractual
obligations to Defendants by retaining their privileged and other confidential materials after
he resigned speak directly to his interrogatory responses that he stored documents, including
the Privileged Documents, on his hard drive “[d]uring the course of his duties.” Jones Decl.
¶ 20, Ex. M at 3. Likewise, questions about communications with Relator’s counsel are
directly relevant to Relator’s claims about his attorneys’ receipt, use, and disclosure of the
Privileged Documents. See Dkt. 85 at 4, 17; Dkt. 85-1 at 17-18; Dkt. 165 at 3, 5.
By refusing to testify about these and other relevant topics, Relator violated the
Court’s Order compelling his testimony regarding the receipt, use, and disclosure of the

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-35Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 42 of 49

Privileged Documents, Dkt. 199 at 14, and Relator should be compelled to testify further and
to answer all questions related to those matters. Additionally, because Defendants learned of
the gravest misconduct, the destruction of his home computer, only after his deposition,
Relator should be ordered to testify regarding his spoliation of evidence as well.
2.

The Hard Drive, Device Installation Logs, and Personal Email Address
Are Relevant and Proportional to the Needs of the Case

After the deposition, Defendants served Requests for Production specifically seeking
documents and other evidence related to Relator’s receipt, use, and disclosure of the
Privileged Documents. See Jones Decl. ¶ 32, Ex. T. This included (1) the devices Relator
used to access the Privileged Documents or logs from those devices; (2) the communications
he made disclosing or otherwise discussing information in the Privileged Documents; and
(3) documents identifying the email account(s) he used to make those communications. See
id.
Relator’s response represents that the only responsive evidence that remains after his
spoliation is his encrypted external hard drive, documents relating to his private email
address, his email communications with counsel, and possibly logs from Price Armstrong
computers showing how often those computers accessed the flash drive containing the
Privileged Documents and other confidential documents (Relator refuses to tell Defendants
whether these logs are available or have also been destroyed). See id. ¶¶ 34, 36, Exs. V, X.
Yet Relator refuses to produce even this limited information, despite its manifest relevance to
Defendants’ investigation of his access to and use of their privileged communications. When
Defendants asked to meet and confer about Relator’s refusal, and requested that Relator at
least provide a privilege log to assess his claim of privilege, Relator did not respond for weeks
and then refused to produce any evidence when the parties eventually did meet and confer.
See id. ¶¶ 35-36, 38-40, Exs. W-X; see also n. 5, supra.
Relator objects that this discovery is not relevant. See id. ¶ 34, Ex. V; see also Dkt. 85
at 3, n.3. This argument never had merit: these types of documents are directly relevant to

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-36Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 43 of 49

Relator’s misconduct. See, e.g., Xyngular, 2016 WL 4126462, at *1 (the parties “engag[ed] in
lengthy discovery” on sanctionable conduct, including misappropriation of confidential
documents). In any event, this argument cannot possibly stand in the face of the Court’s
Order compelling discovery on precisely these issues. See Dkt. 199; Jones Decl. ¶ 35, Ex. W
at 2.
The encrypted hard drive where Relator stashed the Privileged Documents and other
confidential documents is certainly relevant. Even though analysis of this drive cannot
substitute for an examination of the home computer he threw in the garbage, and even though
Relator stated that he deleted the documents he took from Defendants and stored on the drive,
forensic analysis may be able to obtain relevant information about what documents he stored
on the drive, how he organized those documents (which would also show which documents he
sent to his counsel to substantiate his claims, see Ferris Tr. at 124:19-126:5), when he stored
and deleted those documents, and possibly whether or when he modified and re-saved any of
the documents. See Massoud Decl. ¶¶ 10-12, 15-16. If the drive is still encrypted, additional
precautions must be taken to ensure a forensic analysis will be effective: any password,
passphrase, or other security mechanism Relator possesses that was used to encrypt the drive
must be provided, and Relator must not attempt to decrypt the drive himself before producing
it. See id. ¶ 17.
Relator’s personal email address and Price Armstrong device installation logs likewise
constitute relevant evidence. Relator testified that he has a single email account and that he
used that email account to send the documents he misappropriated from Defendants to his
counsel to substantiate his claims (then refused to answer a question asking for the associated
email address).

See Ferris Tr. at 176:4-177:1.

But the account Relator used to send

documents to his counsel is important to investigating when and how often he transmitted the
Privileged Documents to his counsel. And although Relator testified that he did not send any
of the Privileged Documents to his counsel prior to March 2015, Defendants can hardly be

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-37Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 44 of 49

expected to take his word on this issue, given his repeated misrepresentations and general
inability to recall specific information during his deposition. Any device installation log
remaining on Price Armstrong computers similarly is necessary to evaluate the extent to
which Price Armstrong accessed and transferred the Privileged Documents.
Finally, Relator’s proportionality objection is meritless: it is hardly burdensome to
ask him to get the external hard drive from his garage, see Ferris Tr. at 44:1-2, and produce it
to Defendants; the device installation log is a single file sitting on a computer’s hard drive, see
Massoud Decl. ¶ 6; and it is not credible that documents sufficient to show Relator’s personal
email address would be anything other than trivial to obtain and produce. On the other hand,
the remaining responsive discovery comprises the crux of Defendants’ ability to further
develop the already extensive factual record of Relator’s misconduct. The balance of these
interests thus warrants compelling Relator to produce all remaining evidence responsive to the
Requests, including: (1) the encrypted external hard drive in its current state, together with
any information required to decrypt it as part of a forensic analysis; (2) documents sufficient
to identify Relator’s personal email account; and (3) any remaining device installation logs
from Price Armstrong computers. Relator’s history of spoliating evidence warrants an order
requiring him not to attempt to decrypt or otherwise modify the current state of the encrypted
hard drive.
3.

Relator Waived Any Privilege Over His Communications with Counsel
About Defendants’ Privileged and Confidential Documents

Relator likewise should be compelled to produce communications with or between his
attorneys regarding the receipt, use, or disclosure of the Privileged Documents and other
confidential documents. As Relator wrote, “The attorney-client privilege is intended to be a
shield, not a sword” and “[t]he Ninth Circuit has established when a party . . . asserts a claim
that in fairness requires an examination of otherwise protected communications it waives the
privilege.” Dkt. 150 (Relator’s Suppl. Mot. to Compel Product. of Docs. and Mem. in Supp.)
at 4. Here, Relator has made repeated representations to Defendants and the Court—many of

United States ex rel. Ben Ferris v. Afognak
Native Corp, et al. (3:15-cv-00150-HRH)

-38Case 3:15-cv-00150-HRH Document 234 Filed 03/01/17 Page 45 of 49

which have turned out to be false—about when and how he disclosed the Privileged
Documents to his attorneys and when and how his attorneys accessed and used them. See
generally Dkts. 85, 85-1, 165; see also supra sections II.D.1, III.A.1.c. Defendants “cannot
adequately dispute” these representations without access to the email communications
between Relator and his counsel that Relator claims are privileged. Bittaker v. Woodford, 331
F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir. 2003).

Accordingly, Relator has “abuse[d] the privilege” and

“implicitly waived” it. Id.
Defendants therefore ask the Court to compel Relator to produce the communications
with or between his attorneys regarding the documents Relator took from Defendants
(including the Privileged Documents) or, at minimum, a privilege log that includes date,
author, recipient(s), subject matter, privilege claimed, basis for privilege claimed, and other
information relevant to assessing the claim of privilege, encompassing all such
communications.9
****
Defendants therefore request that, if this Court does not dismiss this action at this
time, the Court (1) overrule Relator’s objections to Defendants’ deposition questions and
Requests; (2) compel Relator to continue his deposition and to actually answer the questions
this time; and (3) compel Relator to produce all remaining evidence responsive to the
Requests.

Responsive evidence includes: the encrypted hard drive and any password,

passphrase, or other key required to decrypt it; any device installation logs that still exist from
Price Armstrong computers showing how often those computers accessed the flash drive
containing the Privileged Documents and Defendants’ other confidential documents;
documents sufficient to identify his personal email account; and all emails and other

9

Indeed, Relator’s prolonged failure to produce such a log is another reason to find
that he has waived attorney-client privilege over responsive email communications. See
Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Mont., 408 F.3d 1142, 1149
(9th Cir. 2005).

communications with or between his attorneys regarding the Privileged Documents and
Defendants’ other confidential documents, or at least a privilege log.

Additionally,

Defendants request an award of reasonable expenses incurred in bringing this motion and as a
result of Relator’s abusive litigation practices, including Relator’s continued deposition and a
forensic inspection of Relator’s encrypted hard drive and any device installation logs that still
exist. See, e.g., Cedar Rapids Lodge & Suites, LLC v. JFS Devel., Inc., No. C09-0175, 2011
WL 13073692, at *2 (D. Iowa Feb. 1, 2011) (compelling Defendants to produce computer
hardware and pay for a forensic inspection); Gardner v. Toyota Motor Corp., No. C080632RAJ, 2010 WL 3733876, at *3-4 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 1, 2010) (awarding attorney’s fees
for continued deposition).

IV.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the case with prejudice as to
Relator, or in the alternative, compel further discovery as requested by Defendants. Under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(5), (b)(5), and the Court’s inherent authority,
Defendants also request an award of reasonable expenses incurred in bringing this motion and
as a result of Relator’s abusive litigation practices.
