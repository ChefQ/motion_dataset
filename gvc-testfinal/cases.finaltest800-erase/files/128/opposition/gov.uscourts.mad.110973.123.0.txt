Case No. 1:07-CV-11481-WGY

RELATOR’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION UNDER
LOCAL RULE 40.1(K) AND REQUEST FOR REASSIGNMENT
Following reversal and remand from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,
defendants move the Court to retain this case for further proceedings (Docket No. 121).
Relator opposes the motion. Because the First Circuit did not include terms in the remand
requiring further proceedings before the original judge, reassignment under Local Rule
40.1(K) is required. Relator therefore requests that the case be reassigned by the clerk.
Under Local Rule 40.1(K)(2), reassignment is mandatory unless the original judge
determines “that there will result a substantial saving in the time of the whole court and
that there is no reason why, in the interest of justice, further proceedings should be
conducted before another judge.” See Rodi v. Southern New England School of Law, 532
F.3d 11, 19 (2008). In light of the First Circuit remand and the particular circumstances
of this case, neither of these two findings may be reached.
With respect to judicial economy, there is no basis to find “a substantial saving in
time of the whole court” would result from the denial of reassignment. Defendants argue
without elaboration that the original judge has “knowledge of the extensive record,” but
there is no showing, or even claim, of extraordinary complexity or prior extended
proceedings. Nor is there a showing of a substantial learning curve for another district
court judge on reassignment. Prior to the appeal, this Court reviewed a full record on the

Case 1:07-cv-11481-WGY Document 123 Filed 07/24/12 Page 2 of 3

parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. But the First Circuit reviewed that same
record in detail, and in its Memorandum Opinion, the Court of Appeals made several key
rulings that rejected defense theories on admissibility and relevance. In light of the First
Circuit opinion, another district court judge would not be required to expend
extraordinary efforts to preside over this case going forward.
Knowledge and familiarity with the case, alone, is insufficient to preclude
reassignment under Local Rule 40.1(K). Had the appeal followed a trial, for example, as
opposed to cross-motions for summary judgment, reassignment under Rule 40.1(K)(1)
would be without exception. A district court judge who presides over the trial would
most likely have extensive knowledge and understanding of the record, and yet
reassignment under subsection (1) is required. The local rule thus imposes a default rule
for reassignment, despite the trial judge’s level of knowledge. Under subsection (2) – “In
all other cases in which the mandate of the appellate court requires further proceedings in
this court” – reassignment is mandatory unless the original judge makes express findings
on judicial economy and interests of justice. Clearly, mere knowledge of the facts and
circumstances in “all such other cases” cannot be sufficient to warrant retention in each.
An exception which equates knowledge with judicial economy precluding reassignment
would swallow the rule embodied at Local Rule 40.1(K)(2).
Finally, defendants make no arguments regarding any “interests of justice”
warranting retention of the case with the original judge. As embodied in Local Rule
40.1(K), the interests of justice counsel in favor of reassignment following a reversal by
the Court of Appeals. Presumably, the appellate panel knew and understood the workings
of the local rule, and it refrained from directing a remand to the original judge.
Moreover, on appeal the First Circuit found the district court’s evidentiary ruling to be an
abuse of discretion, while overturning key legal conclusions as contrary to the law. As
such, there is no reason, in the interest of justice, for the original judge to retain the case.
For the foregoing reasons, relator opposes defendants’ motion that this Court retain
the case after remand, and he requests the case be reassigned by the clerk.
