PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
COMES NOW, Plaintiff, ROSA HERNANDEZ (“Plaintiff”), through her attorneys, Krohn
& Moss, Ltd., and files her Response to Defendant’s, MICHAEL J. SCOTT, P.C. (“Defendant”),
Motion to Compel Discovery Responses (“Motion”).
I.

INTRODUCTION
On December 28, 2010, Plaintiff filed her Verified Complaint against Defendant, alleging

Defendant violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq.
See Plaintiff’s Complaint; Document No. 1. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged the following:
10.

11.

12.

13.

Defendant is attempting to collect a debt from Plaintiff on
behalf of the original creditor, Capital One Bank (USA),
N.A., with an account number ending in 4315 (Defendant’s
File Number 90370).
Plaintiff’s alleged debt owed to Capital One Bank (USA),
N.A., arises from transactions for personal, family, and
household purposes.
On October 27, 2009, Plaintiff faxed a cease and desist letter
to Defendant (Plaintiff’s letter to Defendant and the fax
confirmation are attached as Group Exhibit A).
On October 27, 2009, Plaintiff faxed a notice of
representation letters to Defendant (Plaintiff’s letter to

14.

Defendant and the fax confirmation are attached as Group
Exhibit A).
Despite receiving Plaintiff’s letter (Exhibit A), Defendant
communicated with Plaintiff after October 27, 2009, in an
attempt to collect a debt (Defendant’s letter to Plaintiff dated
October 10, 2010, is attached as Exhibit B).

Id. at ¶¶ 10-14. As a result of these unlawful conduct, Defendant violated sections 1692c(a)(2), and
1692c(c) of the FDCPA. Id. at ¶¶ 15. On January 25, 2011, Defendant filed its Answer. See
Defendant’s Answer; Document No. 4. The parties are conducting discovery in this case. On June
2, 2011, Defendant filed this instant Motion to Compel Discovery Responses. See Document No. 8.
In its Motion, Defendant erroneously seeks to compel discovery to its Requests for
Production Nos. 11, 19, 20, 21, and 22:
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 11: Produce all documents
reflecting attorneys’ fees, costs, fee agreements, engagement letters,
billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys representing you in
this case, for which you are seeking compensation.
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 11: Objection.
Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs are not at issue until Plaintiff
prevails in this action. As such, this request seeking the same is
premature at this time. Plaintiff further objects to this Request to the
extent it seeks documents that may be subject to the attorney-client
privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Additionally, this
Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As such,
Plaintiff will not be providing the requested documents at this time.

DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 19: Produce all documents
reflecting attorneys fees, costs, fee agreements, engagement letters,
billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys representing you in
state court lawsuit styled, "Cause No. 20428; LVNV Funding, LLC.
vs. Rosa M. Hernandez"
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 19: Plaintiff
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents that may be
subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product
doctrine. Additionally, this Request seeks documents that are

Case 5:10-cv-01051-OLG Document 10 Filed 06/13/11 Page 3 of 8

irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the
requested documents at this time.
*

*

DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 20: Produce all documents
reflecting attorneys’ fees, costs, fee agreements, engagement letters,
billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys representing you
from Debt Counsel for Seniors & the Disabled (DCSD).
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 20: Plaintiff
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents that may be
subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product
doctrine. Additionally, this Request seeks documents that are
irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the
requested documents at this time.
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 21: Produce copies of all documents
in your possession from all present and former doctors seen within
the last five (5) years.
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 21: This Request
seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff
will not be providing the requested documents at this time.
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 22: Produce copies of any
documents, medical or psychiatric records in your possession, which
support your allegation that you have suffered injury, including stress
and/or mental anguish.
RESPONSE TO DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 22: This Request
seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff
will not be providing the requested documents at this time.
Defendant’s Motion at ¶¶ 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10. As discussed infra, however, Defendant’s Motion is
clearly without merit, and thus, should be denied.

II.

LEGAL STANDARD
Defendant’s Requests for Production, and Plaintiff’s Responses to the same are governed by

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 34 and 37. “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34 provides for the
discovery of documents and tangible items. A party seeking discovery must serve a request for
production on the party believed to be in the possession, custody, or control of the documents or
other evidence.” Ledbetter v. United States, 1996 WL 739036 (N.D. Tex. 1996) citing Fed. R. Civ.
P. 34(a). Furthermore “[t]he request is to be in writing and must set forth the desired items with
‘reasonable particularity.’” Id. citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b). Once the requests for production are
properly served on a party, “[t]he party served with a request for production must serve a written
response within 30 days of service, either agreeing to comply with the request or raising a specific
objection to the request.” Id. citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b) (emphasis added). “If necessary, a party
may file a motion to compel compliance with a Rule 34 production request….” Id. citing Fed. R.
Civ. P. 37(a)(2)(B). “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 sets forth an enforcement mechanism
whereby the court may order production.” Id. citing generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 37. However, there is
a limitation on what is discoverable under the Federal Rules. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
26(b)(1) allows the parties to “obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action….” Id. citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1)
(emphasis added).
III.

ARGUMENT
Defendant provides no authority for its conclusory contention that it’s Requests for

Production Nos. 11, 19, and 20 are relevant because Plaintiff “has [allegedly] put attorney’s fees,
along with the fee agreements and billing records, at issue in this case.” Defendant’s Motion at ¶ 5,
6, and 9. Furthermore, Defendant fails to recognize that Plaintiff has never alleged actual damages
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
4

Case 5:10-cv-01051-OLG Document 10 Filed 06/13/11 Page 5 of 8

in this case, making its Requests for Production Nos. 21 and 22 entirely irrelevant and illogical. As
discussed infra, Defendant’s instant Motion is completely baseless, and thus, should be denied.
A.

Defendant Provides No Authority to Support Its Conclusory Assertion
That Plaintiff’s Attorney’s Fees and Costs are Discoverable.

Aside from generally citing to cases discussing the purpose of conducting discovery,
Defendant fails to cite to a single authority in support of its position that Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees
and costs are relevant and discoverable at this stage of litigation. See generally Defendant’s Motion.
Instead, common sense and the applicable law show that this information is not relevant at trial and
only becomes an issue once Plaintiff prevails. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692k (“[I]n the case of any
successful action to enforce the foregoing liability, the cost of the action, together with a reasonable
attorney’s fee as determined by the court”) (emphasis added); see also Womoczyl v. Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC., 2009 WL 3523713 at *2 (E.D. NY 2009) (analyzing a similar fee-shifting provision in
the consumer protection law entitled the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act) (“Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees
in the instant case do not become an issue unless and until Plaintiffs prevail”) (emphasis added);
Pizel v. Monaco Coach Corp., 224 F.R.D. 642, 644 (N.D. Ind. 2004) (“Under this statute, a party
may only recover fees if he finally prevails. There is no guarantee that the parties will ever reach the
issue of attorney’s fees in this case. Requiring the parties to spend the time and money it would
take in complying with a motion to compel would be fruitless because the issue of the fee
agreement is not a material issue at the present time. Simply stating that the agreement might
aid in settlement discussions does not persuade this Court that the information sought is in fact
relevant.”); Cannon v. Newmar Corp., 287 F. Supp. 2d 222, 227 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (“attorney’s fees
do not become an issue until plaintiff prevails”) (emphasis added); Hussein v. General Motors
Corp., 715 N.Y.S. 2d 394, 395 (N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2000) (“[T]he documents sought, bearing as they

5

Case 5:10-cv-01051-OLG Document 10 Filed 06/13/11 Page 6 of 8

do solely upon the issue of attorneys’ fees, are neither material nor necessary at this early stage of
the litigation”). Accordingly, Defendant’s demand for information as to Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees
should be denied, and simply stating that it is necessary “information to make settlement offers,”
should “not persuade this Court that the information sought is in fact relevant.” See Defendant’s
Motion at ¶ 5; Pizel, 224 F.R.D. at 644.
B.

Defendant Fails to Understand Plaintiff is Not Seeking Actual Damages.

Defendant appears to be either confused or decided to recycle a brief from another case
where the plaintiff, unlike this case, may have alleged actual damages. See Defendant’s Motion at ¶
12 (In its Conclusion, Defendant states “Defendant Credit Management, LP, respectfully
requests,” which is clearly the wrong defendant). Plaintiff has never alleged actual damages and
Plaintiff repeated informed Defendant’s counsel of the same. Yet, Defendant seeks to compel
responses to Requests for Production Nos. 21 and 22, which seeks production of documents relating
to actual damages. Defendant’s mistake or misunderstanding is made evidently clear in its
erroneous argument that “Plaintiff’s treatment in connection with any alleged stress or mental
anguish makes up her entire claim for actual damages.” See Defendant’s Motion at ¶ 10
(emphasis added). From the beginning, Plaintiff has only sought statutory damages in this case, and
no actual damages. See Plaintiff’s Complaint. In fact, Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s
Interrogatories make this clear:
INTERROGATORY NO. 5: State the nature of your actual
damages.
RESPONSE TO INTERROGATORY NO. 5: Plaintiff is not
alleging actual damages. See Plaintiff’s Complaint, attached as
Exhibit B, served concurrently with these Responses.
Plaintiff’s counsel also reiterated this fact to Defendant’s counsel when the parties met and conferred
in relation to this instant Motion. It is puzzling how or why Defendant continues to take this clearly
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
6

Case 5:10-cv-01051-OLG Document 10 Filed 06/13/11 Page 7 of 8

erroneous view that Plaintiff is alleging actual damages in this case. Accordingly, requests for
production regarding Plaintiff’s unasserted actual damages are clearly irrelevant, and Defendant’s
motion to compel the production of the same must be denied.
IV.

CONCLUSION
Defendant has not come close to supporting its conclusory assertion that Plaintiff’s attorney’s

fees and costs are discoverable at this stage of litigation, where Plaintiff has yet to be deemed the
prevailing party. Moreover, Defendant fails to comprehend that Plaintiff is not alleging actual
damages in this case. Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses be denied in its entirety.
