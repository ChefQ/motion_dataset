DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
COMES NOW, Defendant Michael J. Scott, P.C. (herein “Scott”), and files this Motion
to Compel Discovery Responses, and would respectfully show to the Court as follows:
I.
FACTS
1.

This case began when Scott attempted to collect a debt Plaintiff owed Capital One Bank.

On October 27, 2009, Jerome Lamet of Debt Counsel for Seniors and the Disabled (“DCSD”)

sent Scott a letter saying that he represented Plaintiff “for the purpose of enforcing their rights
pursuant to all applicable federal statutes.” He also asked that Scott cease and desist direct
contact with Plaintiff.
2.

On October 10, 2010, Scott sent Plaintiff an amicable “Settlement Offer” in the mail –

nearly one year after Lamet’s letter. On December 28, 2010, Plaintiff filed her Initial Petition
alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”). Specifically, she
claims Scott contacted her after it was informed Plaintiff had obtained counsel and after a cease
and desist letter was sent.
3.

Scott sent Discovery Requests to Plaintiff and Plaintiff responded, objecting to the

Requests below. Scott now asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to respond to these Requests
without objection.
II.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
4.

The purpose of discovery is in part to help avoid judicial surprise, narrow the parties’

theories of liability and defense, and give all parties full knowledge of the facts so they can
prepare for trial. See Brown Badgett, Inc. v. Jennings, 842 F.2d 899, 902 (6th Cir. 1988); O2
Micro Int’l v. Monolithic Power Sys., 467 F.3d 1355, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Gary Plastic
Packaging Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith, Inc., 756 F.2d 230, 236 (2nd Cir.
1985).
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 11: Produce all documents reflecting attorneys’ fees,
costs, fee agreements, engagement letters, billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys
representing you in this case, for which you are seeking compensation.
RESPONSE: Objection. Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs are not at issue until Plaintiff
prevails in this action. As such, this request seeking the same is premature at this time. Plaintiff

further objects to this request to the extent it seeks documents that may be subject to the
attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Additionally, this Request seeks
documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the requested documents at this
time.
5.

Plaintiff has requested attorney’s fees as the most significant portion of her damages.

This has put attorney’s fees, along with the fee agreements and billing records, at issue in this
case, thereby making it relevant information. Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees as part of her
damages makes this information reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. It is also
properly discoverable information regarding the interests and incentives of the parties involved.
The documents contain necessary information in making proper settlement offers, as well as
factual issues to which Scott is entitled. Scott should also be given an idea of what Plaintiff
expects to collect if she prevails.

It is Plaintiff’s burden to prove that the attorney-client

privilege she claims outweighs the relevancy of these documents. Plaintiff also “must show
specifically” how the request is irrelevant or overly broad, which her response failed to do. See
Josephs v. Harris Corp., 677 F. 2d 985, 992 (3d Cir. 1982). Plaintiff should be compelled to
produce these documents without objection.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 19: Produce all documents reflecting attorneys’ fees,
costs, fee agreements, engagement letters, billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys
representing you in state court lawsuit styled, “Cause No. 20428; LVNV Funding, LLC. vs. Rosa
M. Hernandez.”
RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents that may be
subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Additionally, this
Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the requested
documents at this time.
6.

Again, Plaintiff has requested attorney’s fees as the most significant portion of her

damages. This has put attorney’s fees, along with the fee agreements and billing records, at issue
in this case, thereby making it relevant information. Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees as part

of her damages makes this information reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. It
is also properly discoverable information regarding the interests and incentives of the parties
involved.
7.

The documents contain necessary information in making proper settlement offers, as well

as factual issues to which Scott is entitled. Scott should also be given an idea of what Plaintiff
expects to collect if she prevails. It is Plaintiff’s burden to prove that the privileges she claims
outweigh the relevancy of these documents. Plaintiff also “must show specifically” how the
request is irrelevant, which her response failed to do. See Josephs v. Harris Corp., 677 F. 2d
985, 992 (3d Cir. 1982). Plaintiff should be compelled to produce these documents without
objection.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 20: Produce all documents reflecting attorneys’ fees,
costs, fee agreements, engagement letters, billing records and/or invoices, from the attorneys
representing you from Debt Counsel for Seniors & the Disabled (DCSD).
RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents that may be
subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product doctrine. Additionally, this
Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the requested
documents at this time.
8.

Plaintiff has alleged that DSCD and/or Jerome Lamet are her attorneys. She alleges that

MJS should not have contacted her based on that representation.

Plaintiff is not in fact

represented by Lamet as to the debt. Defendant is entitled to see documents Plaintiff alleges
support that alleged representation.
9.

Plaintiff has requested attorney’s fees as the most significant portion of her damages.

This has put attorney’s fees, along with the fee agreements and billing records, at issue in this
case, thereby making it relevant information. Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees as part of her
damages makes this information reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. It is also

properly discoverable information regarding the interests and incentives of the parties involved.
The documents contain necessary information in making proper settlement offers, as well as
factual issues to which Scott is entitled. Scott should also be given an idea of what Plaintiff
expects to collect if she prevails.

It is Plaintiff’s burden to prove that the attorney-client

privilege she claims outweighs the relevancy of these documents. Plaintiff also “must show
specifically” how the request is irrelevant or overly broad, which her response failed to do. See
Josephs v. Harris Corp., 677 F. 2d 985, 992 (3d Cir. 1982). Plaintiff should be compelled to
produce these documents without objection.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 21: Produce copies of all documents in your possession
from all present and former doctors seen within the last five (5) years.
RESPONSE: This Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the
requested documents at this time.
10.

Plaintiff’s treatment in connection with any alleged stress or mental anguish makes up

her entire claim for actual damages, making this information directly relevant to the costs she
hopes to recover from Scott. Plaintiff also hopes to recover mental anguish damages as a
significant portion of her total damages. Scott needs this information to make settlement offers.
Scott should be given an idea of what Plaintiff hopes to recover if she prevails. It is also
properly discoverable information regarding the interests and incentives of the parties involved.
Plaintiff’s response is a “failure to adequately answer interrogatories,” a practice warned against
by the courts. See Denton v. Mr. Swiss of Mo., Inc., 564 F.2d 236, 240 (8th Cir. 1977). In fact,
in similar situations courts have explained that “without information concerning [Plaintiff’s]
alleged injury and damages, [Defendants] could not be expected to adequately prepare their case
for trial.” Id. at 241. Plaintiff should be compelled to adequately answer the interrogatory.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 22: Produce copies of any documents, medical or

psychiatric records in your possession, which support your allegation that you have suffered
injury, including stress and/or mental anguish.
RESPONSE: This Request seeks documents that are irrelevant and is not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. As such, Plaintiff will not be providing the
requested documents at this time.
11.

Again, Plaintiff’s treatment in connection with any alleged stress or mental anguish

makes up her entire claim for actual damages, so this information is directly relevant to the costs
she hopes to recover from Scott. Plaintiff also hopes to recover mental anguish damages as a
significant portion of her total damages. Scott needs this information to make settlement offers.
Scott should be given an idea of what Plaintiff hopes to recover if she prevails. It is also
properly discoverable information regarding the interests and incentives of the parties involved.
In similar situations, courts have explained that “without information concerning [Plaintiff’s]
alleged injury and damages, [Defendants] could not be expected to adequately prepare their case
for trial.”

Id. at 241.

Plaintiff should be compelled to answer the interrogatory without

objection.

CONCLUSION
12.

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Credit Management, LP,

respectfully requests that the Court Compel Plaintiff to provide the requested documents and for
such other and further relief as it may show itself justly entitled.
