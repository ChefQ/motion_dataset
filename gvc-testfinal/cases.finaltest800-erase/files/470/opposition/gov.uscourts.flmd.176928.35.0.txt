STATEMENT OF FACTS
1.

Introduction

For purposes of their Motion for Summary Judgment, the Collier County Sheriff’s Office
assumes, arguendo, that Plaintiff Stakey’s rights were under pursuant to the Fourth Amendment
were violated1.

Stakey’s “Statement of Facts” addresses, therefore, only the issues raised in

Defendant Collier County Sherif’s Offices’s motion for summary judgment as to Count III, and not
the specific (and disputed) circumstances of Stakey’s civil commitment pursuant to the “Hal S.
Marchman Alcohol and Other Drug Services Act of 1993” [hereinafter Marchman Act], Florida
Statute § 397.675.

Testimony of Defendant Amy Stanford

Stanford began her career with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office as a corrections officers,
and began working as a road patrol officer in August, 2001. (Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 4-5).
In Stanford’s entire career as a road patrol officer there has never been any instance where she has
failed to offer a DUI suspect the opportunity to submit take roadside sobriety tasks. There has also

The circumstances of Stakey’s involuntary civil commitment are the subject of a significant
number of material disputes of fact. No motion for summary judgement was filed by either
Defendant Stanford, individually, or Defendant Salls, individually.

never been any instance where Defendant Stanford has failed to offer a person arrested for DUI the
opportunity to submit to breath alcohol testing. (Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 30-31).
Defendant Stanford explained that, insofar as the Collier County Sheriff’s Office is
concerned, the principles applicable to DUI arrests do not apply to civil commitments under the
Marchman Act. Defendant Stanford testified:
Q.
[By Mr. Koerner]
Did you see Mr. Medina conduct any
investigation that would allow him to determine whether Mr. Stakey was
intoxicated?
A.

[By Defendant Stanford]

I don't remember if I did.

***
Q.
Would you agree with me that to conduct a good faith and reasonable
investigation as to whether someone is intoxicated, to use your term, that you want
to do the same sorts of investigations or investigating that you would do under
circumstances where you are trying to apprehend someone who may have been
driving under the influence of alcoholic beverages or chemical or controlled
substances?
A.

No.

Q.
Why is it that you would not conduct the same sort of investigations
that you would do in the context of a DUI under the circumstances that you
encounter[ed] with Mr. Stakey?
A.

I was not trained to do that for a Marchman Act.

(Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 124-25).
Q.
According to Dan Salls, this person [Stakey] was just walking down
the street, correct?
A.

Yes. Observed by Dan Salls.

Q.
And there is no indication that the person is acting in a furtive
manner, hiding, that sort of thing, correct?
A.

Correct.

No.

Q.

They’re not acting in a suspicious manner whatsoever, correct?

A.

Q.
Did he [Stakey] appear to be sick or injured when you first came into
contact with him?
A.

Did you call for an ambulance when you first came into contact with

No.

Q.

You had no fear for his physical safety when he was out with you?

No.

Q.

Where was Mr. Stakey taken for the Marchman Act?

A.

He was taken to the Naples Jail Center.

Q.

Is there a breathalyzer there?

A.

Yes.

Why is it that you didn’t have Mr. Stakey take a breathalyzer at the

Q.
Why is it that you yourself didn’t offer Mr. Stakey the opportunity for
a breathalyzer?
A.

I wasn’t trained to do that for Marchman Act.

(Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 140-41).
Defendant Standford estimated that she has subjected between 50-100 persons to involuntary
civil commitment during her career with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office. (Deposition of Amy
Stanford, p. 163). Defendant Stanford is not aware of any member of the Collier County Sheriff’s
Office administering roadside sobriety tasks prior to any civil commitment. Defendant Stanford
testified:
Q.
Have you ever heard of an instance for when your colleagues
Marchman Acted somebody?
A.

Yes.

Q.
And have you ever observed anybody at your department give
somebody the road side sobriety tests prior to Marchman Acting somebody for
alcohol abuse?
A.

Never.

Q.
Would you agree with me that it is the customary practice and policy
of the Collier County Sheriff's Office to not administer any sobriety tests of persons
prior to their commitment under the Marchman Act?
A.
I’ve never done that myself. I’ve never seen anyone do that for the
Marchman Act.
Q.
So would you agree with me that it seems to be the customary practice
of both yourself and your colleagues at the Collier County Sheriff’s Office to not
have persons perform any sobriety tests prior to committing them pursuant to the
Marchman Act?
A.

Yes.
***

Q.
And if I understand your testimony correctly, it is your position that
the reason that you did not submit Mr. Stakey to any sort of sobriety testing was that
the policies at the Collier County Sheriff’s Office did not direct you to subject Mr.
Stakey to such testing, correct?

5

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

A.

Filed 12/23/06 Page 6 of 26 PageID 207

Yeah, I wasn't trained to do that.

Q.
And customarily nobody ever subjects anybody to sobriety testing for
Marchman Acting them, correct?
A.

Yes.

Q.
You would agree with me that had the policy said to conduct an
investigation regarding whether somebody is in fact under the influence of alcohol
by administering sobriety tests and/or chemical breath tests that you would have
done so, correct?
A.

Yes.

(Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 165-66, 169-70).

Testimony of Defendant Daniel Salls

The testimony of Salls is consistent with Stanford’s testimony. Salls testified:
Q.
[By Mr. Koerner]
. . . Is there any instance you can think of as
you sit here today in your entire career with the Collier County Sheriff's Office
where you became aware of any Marchman Act done by any deputy in which there
was ever a circumstance where the person Marchman Acted was afforded the
opportunity to take those road side sobriety tasks before or after being taken into
custody?
A.

[By Daniel Salls]

Not that I recall.

Q.
Did you ever instruct your trainees or recruits that as a precondition
of taking someone into custody under Marchman Act that they should be afforded
the opportunity to submit to road side sobriety tasks?
A.

I don't believe so.

Q.
Why is it that [if] a person has a constitutional right not to be deprived
of their liberty in the absence of probable cause, either [because] they committed a
crime or [fit the] criteria for Marchman, would you in a DUI context at least offer
these road side sobriety tasks to those people that are too drink [sic] but in
Marchman you can't tell me that this happens as a matter of course?
A.

I can't tell you that, sir. This is just how we were trained.

Person(s) with the most knowledge at the Collier County Sheriff’s Office of the
number of persons annually subjected to civil commitment by the Sheriff of
Collier County pursuant to the Marchman Act (for the 5 year period ending
November 10, 2002).

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), Commander Joe Bastys was presented as the person
with the most knowledge of the number of individuals annually subjected to civil commitment by
the Sheriff of Collier County pursuant to the Marchman Act (for the 5 year period ending November
10, 2002).
Commander Bastys testified that every person who is Marchman Acted in Collier County
is taken to the Collier County Jail. (Deposition of Joe Bastys, p. 17). There is no record, however,
of which police agency in Collier County performed the Marchman Act. (Deposition of Joe Bastys,
p. 18).
The Collier County Sheriff’s Office has approximately 600 certified law enforcement
officers. (Deposition of Joe Bastys, p. 18). The next largest police department in Collier County
is the City of Naples Police Department, with less than 50 certified law enforcement officers.
(Deposition of Joe Bastys, p. 20). The Florida Wildlife Commission, Florida Marine Patrol, Florida
Highway Patrol, and some park rangers in the Big Cypress area, also have arrest powers.
(Deposition of Joe Bastys, pp. 20-21).

Finally, the City of Marco Island has a small police

department. (Deposition of Joe Bastys, pp. 24-25).
According to Commander Bastys, given its size, the vast majority of involuntary civil
commitments are made by the Collier County Sheriff’s Office. (Deposition of Joe Bastys, p. 25).
The following chart depicts the number of persons annually admitted into the Collier County
Jail for the years 1997-2002. As reflected in the chart, for the year 2002, nearly 15% (that is not
a typographical error) of all persons admitted into the Collier County Jail were jailed on the basis

Don Hunter, the Sheriff of Collier County, is provided with a “quarterly report” which
includes the number of persons admitted into the Collier County Jail, as well as the number of
persons admitted into the Collier County Jail based on the Marchman Act. (Deposition of Joe
Bastys, pp. 53-55).
According to Commander Bastys, there has never been any procedure (during the time frame
of 1997-2002) which afforded Marchman Act detainees the opportunity to take a breath test.
(Deposition of Joe Bastys, p. 43). Nor has the jail (during the time frame of 1997-2002) ever
provided Marchman Act detainees the opportunity to submit to so-called roadside sobriety tests.

Person or persons with the most knowledge at the Collier County Sheriff’s
Office of the training provided to law enforcement officers for the Sheriff of
Collier County concerning the investigation and processing of persons suspected
of fitting the criteria for civil commitment pursuant to the Marchman Act (as
of November 10, 2002), including the administration of sobriety testing and
breath alcohol testing.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), Lieutenant Jeremiah Carroll, a “Field Supervisor” for
the Collier County Sheriff’s Office, was designated as the person with the most knowledge of the
training provided to law enforcement officers for the Sheriff of Collier County concerning the
investigation and processing of persons suspected of fitting the criteria for civil commitment
pursuant to the Marchman Act (as of November 10, 2002), including the administration of sobriety
testing and breath alcohol testing. As of November 20, 2002, Lieutenant Carroll was responsible
for training at the Collier County Sheriff’s Office (Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, p. 8). Lieutenant
Carroll has 18 ½ years experience with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office.

(Deposition of

Jeremiah Carroll, p. 7). Lieutenant Carroll testified:
Q.
Are you aware of anybody at any level instructing people with regards
to DUI investigations - - not the Marchman Act - - DUI investigations that there is
a constitutional obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable
cause?
A.
For DUI?
Q.

Yes.

A.

Yes.

Q.
Do you agree that that same constitutional obligation to conduct a
reasonable investigation to establish probable cause pertains to involuntary civil
commitment pursuant to the Marchman Act?
A.

No

No. One is a civil infraction, and the other is a criminal infraction.
We have to differentiate between the two.
(Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, pp. 11-12).
***
Q.
And you seem to be telling me that for purposes of instructing your
subordinates that you differentiate at some level between what I have just described
in the criminal context and what you teach in regards to Marchman Acts; correct?
A.

Correct.

Q.
Can you explain to me how you differentiate between the criminal
context and the civil commitment context to the subordinate that is trying to get the
understanding?
A.
They are treated -- under the civil commitment they are treated as a
victim so, therefore, there would be no seizure of them -- of their person under the
probable cause constitutional Fourth Amendment.

Q.
Are you teaching your subordinates for purposes of training that when
you take someone and deprive them of their liberty under the Marchman Act by
civilly committing them against their will that that is not a seizure under the Fourth
Amendment?
A.

Yes.

Q.
And, to the best of your knowledge, is that something that is taught
by the persons who have been training deputies at your agency since the time that
you have been involved in training?
A.

Yes, sir, it is.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), Lieutenant Carroll was also designated as the person

pursuant to the Marchman Act (as of November 10, 2002), including the administration of sobriety
testing and breath alcohol testing. (Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, pp. 6-7, 10).
Q.
And because you perceive the civil commitment or the Marchman Act
to not be a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, would you agree with me that you
have not seen a corresponding obligation for officers to offer roadside sobriety tests,
drug recognition experts, chemical breath tests in the context of civil commitment
under the Marchman Act?
A.

That is correct.

Q.
Would you also agree with me that there is a widespread practice in
Collier County of doing different types of investigations in the context of a DUI
arrest as opposed to a civil commitment under the Marchman Act?
A.

Can you state that again.

Q.
Yeah. I am trying to say in plain language that I accept your
explanation that as a matter of course given the chance that people who are suspected
of DUI in Collier County are offered roadside sobriety tests, and after their arrest,
they are offered a breath test; correct?
A.

Yes.

Q.
And it is my understanding based upon what I have been told is that
none of that happens in the Marchman context. There are no roadside sobriety tasks
as a matter of course; there are no breath tests as a matter of course; is that accurate?
A.

That is accurate.

Testimony of Captain Albert Beatty

On October 27, 2006, Captain Albert Beatty, the head of Professional Responsibility for the
Collier County Sheriff’s Office, was produced pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). According to
Captain Beatty, for the past 10 years, there has never been any officer disciplined for any matter
relating to the decision to subject an individual to civil commitment pursuant to the Marchman Act.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, p. 12). Captain Beatty testified:

And as long as you have been in the agency, are you aware of there
being any particular policies or procedures that specifically govern how a deputy is

committing a person subject to the Marchman Act?
A.

Is there an agency policy regarding that?

Q.

Yes.

A.

Yes.

Q.

Beyond what I have here that quotes the statute, is there any policy?

A.

No, sir. I believe our policy mirrors the state statute.

Q.

Well, it is identical to the state statute. It quotes it; correct?

A.

I believe so, sir.

Q.
It says nothing with regards to how the state statute should be
implemented; correct?
A.

I believe that is correct.
***

Q.
Aside from failing to follow state law, there is nothing that guides or
serves as a policy with regards to persons civilly committed by your department;
correct?
A.

I guess I would agree with that.

(Deposition of Albert Beatty, pp. 12-13).
Q.
You would agree with me that you can't civilly commit someone
unless there is probable cause that they fit the criteria for involuntary civil
commitment pursuant to Florida law; correct?
A.

I would agree with that.

Q.

We can agree to those basic premises; true?

A.

Yes, sir.

Q.
From that starting point, you would also agree with me that police
officers in your department had a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to
establish probable cause; correct?

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

A.

Filed 12/23/06 Page 14 of 26 PageID 215

I agree.

Q.
What is it in your agency pursuant to your policies that constitutes
reasonable investigation to establish probable cause pursuant to the Marchman Act?
A.
Well, the officer is going to -- you can go by the Florida statute. That
would establish- in his own mind that the person met the criteria for being Marchman
Acted.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, pp. 15-16).
Q.
Is there anything that you are aware of that your officers are, pursuant
to your policies, directed to do that provides objective criteria scientific or otherwise
to aid the officer in making their determination as to whether someone fits the
criteria for involuntary civil commitment?
A.
If you are asking -- to use something like a Breathalyzer or
specifically doing the field sobriety tests, no, I don't believe that is an agency policy.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, p. 23).
Q.
But if similarly people are being committed across the agency on a
regular basis without there ever being an opportunity for roadside sobriety tests -breath tests, that does not trouble you in the least. Is that my understanding of your
testimony?
A.

I don't believe the state statute requires it.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
1.

Application of the Fourth Amendment in civil cases

The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that the Fourth Amendment is
applicable to governmental conduct that is civil in nature. Soldal v. Cook County, Illinois, 113 S.Ct.
538, 548 (1992); O’Connor v. Ortega, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 1496 (1987); New Jersey v. T.L.O., 105 S.Ct.
733, 739 (1985). Lieutenant Carroll testified concerning the training policies of the Collier County
Sheriff’s Office:

14

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 15 of 26 PageID 216

Q.
Are you teaching your subordinates for purposes of training that when
you take someone and deprive them of their liberty under the Marchman Act by
civilly committing them against their will that that is not a seizure under the Fourth
Amendment?
A.

Yes.

Q.
And, to the best of your knowledge, is that something that is taught
by the persons who have been training deputies at your agency since the time that
you have been involved in training?
A.

Yes, sir, it is.

Q.
And was that same policy taught when you were an up-and-coming
law enforcement officer?
A.

Yes.

(Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, pp. 16-17). Put simply, Lt. Carroll is incorrect. An involuntary
commitment under the Marchman Act constitutes a “seizure” under the Fourth Amendment.
2.

Application of the probable cause standard in involuntary civil commitment
cases

Every Circuit Court of Appeal to decide the issue has concluded that the probable cause
requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to claims of involuntary civil commitment. Anaya
v. Crossroads Managed Care Systems, Inc., 195 F.3d 584, 594 (10th Cir. 1999); Maag v. Wessler,
960 F.3d 773, 775 (9th Cir. 1991); Harris v. Pirch, 677 F.2d 681, 686 (8th Cir. 1982);McKinney v.
George, 726 F.2d 1183, 1187 (7th Cir. 1984); Fisher v. Harden, 398 F.3d 837, 842-43 (6th Cir. 2005);
Monday v. Oullette, 118 F.3d 1099, 1102 (6th Cir. 1997); Martinez v. Smith, 200 F.3d 816, 1999 WL
1095667 *1 (5th Cir. 1999); Gooden v. Howard County, Maryland, 954 F.2d 960, 967-68 (4th Cir.
1991); Glass v. Mayas, 984 F.2d 55, 58 (2nd Cir. 1993); McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Service,
Inc., 77 F.3d 540, 544 (1st Cir. 1996); In re Barnard, 455 F.2d 1370, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 1971). Even
the Collier County Sheriff’s Office agrees that you cannot subject a person to involuntary civil
15

Filed 12/23/06 Page 16 of 26 PageID 217

commitment unless there is probable cause that they fit the statutory criteria set forth in the
Marchman Act. (Deposition of Albert Beatty, pp. 15-16).
3.

Duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable cause

It is well settled that law enforcement officials have a duty to “conduct a reasonable
investigation to establish probable cause.” Rankin v. Evans, 133 F.3d 1425, 1436 (11th Cir. 1998).
Although an investigation need not be error-free, officers may not “investigate selectively” or
perform “investigation[s] in a biased fashion or elect not to obtain easily discoverable facts . . .”
Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2004) (false arrest claim based in part
upon theory that police officer’s failure to call in drug-sniffing dog to corroborate officer’s claim
that vehicle smelled of cannabis). This approach “serves to deter dishonest officers from fabricating
charges to cover up improper detentions. . . .” Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d at 1229 (citing
Sevigny v. Dicksey, 846 F.2d 953 (4th Cir.1988)).
“[T]he standard for determining the existence of probable cause is the same under both
Florida and federal law.” Rankin v. Evans, 133 F.3d 1425, 1433 (11th Cir. 1998). This includes the
duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable cause. Harris v. Lewis State Bank,
482 So.2d 1378, 1382 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986).
Lieutenant Carroll testified that in his position as the person with the most knowledge at the
Collier County Sheriff's Office of the polices, or customs, practices, and usages of the Collier
County Sherif’s Office concerning the investigation of persons suspected of fitting the criteria for
civil commitment pursuant to the Marchman Act, that he had the authority to speak on behalf of
Sheriff Don Hunter. (Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, pp. 27-28). In this capacity, Carroll testified
that it was the official policy or the custom, practice, and usage of the Collier County Sheriff’s

16

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 17 of 26 PageID 218

Office that the constitutional obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable
cause does not apply to investigations under the Marchman Act. Carroll explained: “One is a civil
infraction, and the other is a criminal infraction. We have to differentiate between the two.”
(Deposition of Jeremiah Carroll, pp. 11-12).

This is a flatly unconstitutional policy, custom,

practice, or usage. It is also a policy, custom, practice, or usage that is faithfully followed, and
widespread.

Most importantly, it was an official policy, custom, practice, or usage dutifully

followed by Stanford. (Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 165-66, 169-70).

State law statutes and immunities, and the Fourth Amendment

Florida Statute § 397.675, the “Hal S. Marchman Alcohol and Other Drug Services Act of
1993,” provides:
Criteria for involuntary admissions, including protective custody, emergency
admission, and other involuntary assessment, involuntary treatment, and
alternative involuntary assessment for minors, for purposes of assessment and
stabilization, and for involuntary treatment – A person meets the criteria for
involuntary admission if there is good faith reason to believe the person is substance
abuse impaired and, because of such impairment:
(1)

Has lost the power of self-control with respect to substance use; and either

(2)(a) Has inflicted, or threatened or attempted to inflict, or unless admitted is likely
to inflict, physical harm on himself or herself or another; or
(b)
Is in need of substance abuse services and, by reason of substance abuse
impairment, his or her judgment has been so impaired that the person is incapable of
appreciating his or her need for such services and of making a rational decision in
regard thereto; however, mere refusal to receive such services does not constitute
evidence of lack of judgment with respect to his or her need for such services.
Additionally, Florida Statute § 397.6775 states that “[a] law enforcement officer acting in
good faith pursuant to this part may not be held criminally or civilly liable for false imprisonment.”

17

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 18 of 26 PageID 219

Based on the “good faith” language contained in Florida Statute § 397.675 (and possibly
Florida Statute § 397.6775), the Collier County Sheriff’s Office adopted a policy, custom, or
practice of failing to conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable cause in Marchman
Act cases. As Captain Albert Beatty testified:
Q.
What is it in your agency pursuant to your policies that constitutes
reasonable investigation to establish probable cause pursuant to the Marchman Act?
A.
Well, the officer is going to -- you can go by the Florida statute. That
would establish- in his own mind that the person met the criteria for being Marchman
Acted.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, pp. 15-16).
Q.
Is there anything that you are aware of that your officers are, pursuant
to your policies, directed to do that provides objective criteria scientific or otherwise
to aid the officer in making their determination as to whether someone fits the
criteria for involuntary civil commitment?
A.
If you are asking -- to use something like a Breathalyzer or
specifically doing the field sobriety tests, no, I don't believe that is an agency policy.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, p. 23).
Q.
But if similarly people are being committed across the agency on a
regular basis without there ever being an opportunity for roadside sobriety tests -breath tests, that does not trouble you in the least. Is that my understanding of your
testimony?
A.

I don't believe the state statute requires it.

(Deposition of Albert Beatty, p. 42).
Captain Beatty’s understanding of Florida Statute § 397.675, at least in light of the
requirements of the Fourth Amendment, are flawed. First, the “good faith” language contained in
the Marchman Act must be read in conjunction with requirements of the Fourth Amendment, which
turns on probable cause, not “good faith.”

18

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 19 of 26 PageID 220

The Marchman Act was enacted in 1993, and pre-dates the United States Supreme Court’s
decision in Whren v. United States, 116 S.Ct. 1769 (1996), which held that “[s]ubjective intentions
play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.” Id. at 813. In short, in order
to construe Florida Statute §397.675 in a constitutional manner, “good faith” necessarily means
probable cause, since any seizure in the absence of probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment.
In this regard, Captain Beatty is patently incorrect when he testified that an officer may
subject an individual to involuntary civil commitment under the Marchman Act when the officer,
“in his own mind,” believes that the person fits the criteria for involuntary civil commitment.
(Deposition of Albert Beatty, pp. 15-16). The standard under the Fourth Amendment is objective,
not subjective, and under the objective reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment, officers
have a duty to “conduct a reasonable investigation to establish probable cause.” Rankin v. Evans,
133 F.3d 1425, 1436 (11th Cir. 1998).
Thus, there is no constitutionally sufficient explanation for the policy, custom, practice, or
usage of the Collier County Sheriff’s Office of offering DUI suspects roadside sobriety tests and
breath alcohol testing, while relying solely upon the subjective state of mind of the officer in the
context of the Marchan Act.

This problem is exasperated by the fact that DUI arrests, like

involuntary civil commitments under the Marchman Act, are crimes of opinion, i.e., whether a DUI
suspects normal faculties are impaired, or whether a Marchman Act candidate “[h]as lost the power
of self-control with respect to substance use” and “by reason of substance abuse impairment, his or
her judgment has been so impaired that the person is incapable of appreciating his or her need for
such services and of making a rational decision in regard thereto.”
In short, the “opinion” of the officer in both the DUI and Marchman Act context must be

19

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 20 of 26 PageID 221

based on objectively reasonable information sufficient to satisfy the probable cause requirement of
the Fourth Amendment. “The history of the use, and not infrequent abuse, of the power to arrest
cautions that a relaxation of the fundamental requirements of probable cause would “‘leave lawabiding citizens at the mercy of the officers’ whim or caprice.” Wong Sun v. U.S., 83 S.Ct. 407,
413 (1963) (quoting Brinegar v. United States, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311 (1949)).
Secondly, Florida Statute § 397.6775 provides law enforcement officers immunity from
criminal or civil liability for false imprisonment so long as they act in “good faith.” Contrary to the
understanding of the Collier County Sheriff’s Office, the “good faith” exception set forth in Florida
Statue § 397.6775 has no application to claims for relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
In Howlett v. Rose, 110 S.Ct. 2430 (1990), a unanimous United States Supreme Court
rejected a similar argument with regards to the state law immunities set forth in Florida Statute §
768.28,2 in the context of a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Justice Stevens, writing for the
Court, concluded: “To the extent that the Florida law of sovereign immunity reflects a substantive
disagreement with the extent to which governmental entities should be held liable for their
constitutional violations, that disagreement cannot override the dictates of federal law.” Howlett v.
Rose, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 2444 (1990). Similarly, the “good faith” immunity exceptions set forth in

Florida Statue § 397.6775 have no application to constitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Florida Statue § 768.28(9)(a) provides in pertinent part that
No officer, employee, or agent of the state or of any of its subdivisions shall
be held personally liable in tort or named as a party defendant in any action for any
injury or damage suffered as a result of any act, event, or omission of action in the
scope of her or his employment or function, unless such officer, employee, or agent
acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and
willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.

Finally, Florida Statue § 397.6775 provides that “[a] law enforcement officer acting in good
faith pursuant to this part may not be held criminally or civilly liable for false imprisonment.” This
section includes the term “law enforcement officer,” not law enforcement agency, or constitutional
officer (including a Sheriff sued in his official capacity). Simply put, the immunity contained in
Florida Statue § 397.6775 is no different than any of the other state law immunities provided to law
enforcement officers sued in their individual capacities under Florida law, such as the immunities
provided in Florida Statute § 741.29(5) and Florida Statute § 901.15(7). Those statutes, like the
“good faith” language contained in Florida Statute § 397.6775, provide nothing more than what is
already provided in Florida Statue § 768.28(9)(a), which affords governmental employees immunity
from being named in suit so long as they do not act in “bad faith.”

Custom, policy, and practice claims

There is no respondeat superior liability under § 1983. Griffin v. City of Opa Locka, 261
F.3d 1295, 1307 (2001). When suing local officials in their official capacities under § 1983, the
Plaintiff has the burden to show that a deprivation of constitutional rights occurred as a result of an
official government policy or custom, Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1221 (11th Cir. 2005), or the
lack of necessary policies. Rivas v. Freeman, 940 F.2d 1491, 1495 (11th Cir. 1991) (“As Sheriff of
Monroe County, Freeman was directly responsible for formulating policies concerning correct and
accurate identification of suspects and ensuring that suspects are accounted for while incarcerated.
The evidence presented at trial clearly demonstrated that Sheriff Freeman failed to establish such
policies. This lack of well-established policies and procedures caused Rivas's arrest, his unnecessary
six-day incarceration, and his resulting humiliation”). Id. “A policy is a decision that is officially
adopted by the municipality, or created by an official of such rank that he or she could be said to be

21

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 22 of 26 PageID 223

acting on behalf of the municipality. A custom is a practice that is so settled and permanent that it
takes on the force of law.”Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1221 (11th Cir. 2005).
It is well settled that “[a] municipality’s failure to correct the constitutionally offensive
actions of its police department may rise to the level of a ‘custom or policy’ if the municipality
tacitly authorizes these actions or displays deliberate indifference towards the police misconduct.”
Brooks v. Scheib, 813 F.2d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir. 1987); Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332,
1345 (11th Cir. 1994). Additionally, liability may also be imposed
based on governmental custom even though such a custom has not received formal
approval through the body's official decision-making channels. . . . [T]o prove §
1983 liability against a municipality based on custom, a plaintiff must establish a
widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express
municipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage
with the force of law.
Griffin v. City of Opa Locka, 261 F.3d 1295, 1308 (2001 (citations and quotations omitted).
Liability may be imposed for a single decision by policymakers under appropriate
circumstances. Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1221 (11th Cir.2005) (citing Pembaur v. City of
Cincinnati, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 1298 (1986)). As the Court in Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati explained:
“Indeed, any other conclusion would be inconsistent with the principles underlying § 1983. To be
sure, ‘official policy’ often refers to formal rules or understandings-often but not always committed
to writing-that are intended to, and do, establish fixed plans of action to be followed under similar
circumstances consistently and over time. That was the case in Monell itself . . . .” Id. at 1299.
Finally, a governmental entity may incur liability under § 1983 where its failure to train its
employees proximately caused the constitutional violation. City of Canton v. Harris, 109 S.Ct.
1197, 1205 (1989). As explained by the Eleventh Circuit in Williams v. City of Homestead, Florida,
2006 WL 3102305 (11th Cir. 2006), “a § 1983 failure-to-train claim against a municipality is valid
22

Case 2:05-cv-00598-MMH-DNF Document 35

Filed 12/23/06 Page 23 of 26 PageID 224

only in the limited circumstances where a plaintiff can show that: (1) the municipality inadequately
trained or supervised its officers; (2) the failure to train or supervise is a city policy; and (3) the city's
policy caused the officer to violate the plaintiff's constitutional rights.” Id. at *3.
Under each of the foregoing theories, the Sheriff’s motion for summary judgment must be
denied.

It is difficult to image that there is any greater single type of admission into the Collier

County Jail than admissions pursuant to the Marchman Act. Nevertheless, the Sheriff has adopted
and approved an unwritten policy of treating involuntary commitments under the Marchman Act as
“non-seizures.” These “non-seizure” are deemed appropriate when the officer, “in his [or her] own
mind,” believes that the person fits the criteria for involuntary civil commitment. (Deposition of
Albert Beatty, pp. 15-16). Objective testing, including roadside sobriety testing and breath alcohol
testing, while used uniformly in the context of DUI arrests, is eschewed completely in enforcement
of the Marchman Act.

This practice is not just widespread, it is uniform.

And as Stanford

explained, had the Sheriff’s policy required roadside sobriety tests and/or chemical breath tests, she
would have followed the policy. (Deposition of Amy Stanford, p. 169-70).
Stakey never appeared sick or injured, and according to Stanford, she had no fear for his
physical safety when she came into contact with him. (Deposition of Amy Stanford, pp. 140-41).
Stakey was nevertheless subjected to involuntary civil commitment under the Marchman Act,
without the benefit of either roadside sobriety tests or breath alcohol testing. The Sheriff’s motion
for summary judgment does not contest (for purposes of the motion) that Stakey’s constitutional
rights were violated.

The only question, then, is whether the Sheriff’s policies, customs, or

practices, as set forth above, caused Stakey’s involuntary civil commitment, contrary to the Fourth
Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Based on the foregoing, that determination must be made by

23

the finder of fact.

Sheriff’s Office’s motion for summary judgment (as to Count III only).
