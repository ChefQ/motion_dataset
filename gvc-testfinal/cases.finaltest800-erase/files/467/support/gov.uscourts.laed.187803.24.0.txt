MOTION TO COMPEL EXAMINATION UNDER OATH AND APPRAISAL
AND STAY LITIGATION PENDING APPRAISAL

NOW INTO COURT, through undersigned counsel, comes Americas Insurance
Company (hereinafter "AIC"), who files this Motion to Compel Examination Under Oath and
Appraisal and Stay Litigation Pending Appraisal. Prior to plaintiffs, Stacy Morgan and A-Plus
Contractors, L.L.C. (hereinafter "plaintiffs"), filing suit, AIC demanded plaintiffs submit to an
examination under oath contained within the AIC Policy in order for AIC to investigate the claims
arising out of a fire loss. Rather than submit to an examination under oath, plaintiffs repeatedly
delayed and impeded AIC's investigation, and wrongfully circumvented these provisions by filing
suit in violation of the Policy. Indeed, as of the date of the instant filing, plaintiffs have yet to
submit to an examination under oath. As this Honorable Court has previously ruled, plaintiffs
stand in the shoes of the insured. Thus, for plaintiffs to recover under the AIC Policy, under the
assignment of benefits, plaintiffs must comply with the Duties After Loss provision of the AIC
Policy.

Further, AIC previously demanded and invoked the appraisal provision contained within

the AIC Policy. Importantly, this appraisal provision is designed to resolve the disagreement

between the parties as to the extent and value of the damages sustained by plaintiffs and allegedly
covered under the AIC Policy. Therefore, AIC seeks an Order from this Honorable Court
compelling plaintiffs to submit to an examination under oath and provide documentation to support
the claim. AIC further requests an Order requiring the parties to submit to appraisal as required
by the express terms of the AIC Policy, for the reasons set forth more fully in the attached
Memorandum in Support.
WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum in Support,
AIC respectfully requests this Honorable Court grant this Motion to Compel Examination Under
Oath and Appraisal and Stay Litigation Pending Appraisal and prays this Honorable Court:
(1) issue an Order requiring plaintiffs, Stacy Morgan and A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C.,
to submit to an examination under oath as set forth in the AIC Policy, and to provide
AIC with documentation to support the claim;
(2) issue an Order requiring the parties to submit to appraisal as included in the AIC
Policy;
(3) issue an Order staying the suit filed by plaintiffs against AIC pending completion
of appraisal; and
(4) such other and further general and equitable relief to which AIC may be justly

entitled.
