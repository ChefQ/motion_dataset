Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 Requesting Evidentiary Hearing To Settle Contested Issues Of Fact Going To Validity Of
18 Fourth Amendment Searches And Seizures. Through this motion, the defendant respectfully
19 requests that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing so that witness testimony may be heard,
20 and documents in the possession of witnesses may be examined, in order to settle contested
21 issues of fact going to the validity of the Fourth Amendment searches and seizures in
22 question. The defendant also respectfully requests that all subpoenaed witnesses be fully
23 sequestered. The defendant previously filed his Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824) and related
24 filings (specifically, Dkt. #830,[1] #826,[2] #867,[3] and #847).[4] In response, the

1 government filed Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #873)
2 and the defendant thereafter replied via Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's
3 Motion To Suppress.[5] After reading the government's response at Dkt. #873, the defendant
4 was able to identify various relevant facts that are in dispute between the parties that may be
5 resolved through an evidentiary hearing. “An evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress
6 ordinarily is required if the moving papers are sufficiently definite, detailed, and
7 nonconjectural to enable the court to conclude that contested issues of fact going to the

8 validity of the search are in issue.” United States v. Walczak, 783 F.2d 852, 857 (9th Cir.
9 1986). Below, the defendant lists the relevant contested issues of fact with references to the
10 moving papers and sublists of proposed witnesses with explanations as to why their
11 testimony may resolve the contested facts. As noted below, there are 24 additional exhibits
12 attached to the defendant's Fourth Submission Of Consolidated Exhibits Relating To
13 Discovery And Suppression Issues that may act to alleviate the need for testimony from
14 witnesses listed in category Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. See also Motion For Leave To Place
15 Additional Evidence On The Record Responsive To Government Claims Contained In
16 Response To Motion To Suppress. However, the contested issues of fact listed in category
17 Nos. 3 and 7 most certainly require testimony from the noted witnesses—regardless of
18 whether the 24 additional exhibits are considered—in order to resolve the issues relevant to
19 those categories.

1.

Whether the federal agent seizure of the defendant's keys and search of the

21 defendant key and keyhole at his home residence was a valid search incident to arrest. See
22 Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress, Section I(B), to
23 determine whether the fact remains in dispute and whether it goes to the validity of
24 challenged searches and/or seizures. The following witnesses can provide testimony that

1) Witness: IRS-CI Agent Tracy Daun. This witness is the primary agent
responsible for conducting the digital data search/seizure portions of the
N.D.Cal. warrants used to search the defendant's home and storage unit. The
defendant expects this witness to (1) confirm that she indiscriminately fished
through the defendant's data without employing methods that would only
reveal data responsive to the relevant warrants, (2) confirm that she shared
forensic images and virtual machine clones of the defendant's entire computer
system with numerous other federal agents so that they could conduct their
own exploratory rummaging, (3) identify all agents of whom she shared either
extracted data or forensic images and virtual machine clones of the defendant's
entire computer system, and (4) identify with exacting detail each and every
file and piece of data that she looked at while searching the forensic images
and virtual machine clones of the defendant's computer system—which will
provide further evidence of the fishing exhibition claimed by the defendant.
Location of witness: area of Phoenix, AZ.

This motion was drafted by the pro se defendant, however, he authorizes his shadow

25 counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion on his behalf using the ECF system. The
26 defendant is appearing pro se and has never attended law school. The defendant's filings,
27 however inartfully pleaded, must be liberally construed and held to less stringent standards
28 than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
