STATEMENT OF FACTS

7

This action for alleged non-payment of overtime due under the Fair Labor Standards Act

8

(“FLSA”) was filed by 47 Plaintiffs on July 16, 2007. However, Plaintiffs’ claims relate back to

9

a case that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 7, 2003;

10

which case was conditionally certified as a collective action under the FLSA and was later

11

decertified when the court found that the evidence gathered in the course of class-based

12

discovery did “not demonstrate the existence of a common, company-wide practice of non-

13

payment of overtime” and that the plaintiffs’ and opt-ins’ claims could not “overcome the

14

‘disparate factual and employment settings of the individual plaintiffs’ or ‘the various defenses

15

available.’” Chase v. AIMCO, Civ. No. 1:03-CV-01683, at 1, 7, 13-14 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2007)

16

(citation omitted). See Stegeman Decl. Exhibit A. The court then dismissed the claims of the

17

approximately 1,100 persons outside the District of Columbia who had filed consents to join the

18

action – most dating from December 2005 through February 2006.1 Plaintiffs responded by

19

blanketing the federal courts throughout the United States with 21 separate actions (including

20

this action) in their respective jurisdictions in July 2007, asserting the very same claims they had

21

attempted to pursue in the Chase action.

22

In October 2007, Defendants propounded discovery requests on each individual Plaintiff

23

in this case. Plaintiffs’ responses were initially due last November, but Defendants agreed to two

24

extensions, bringing the deadline to January 11, 2008. See Stegeman Decl. ¶ 2. At that time,

25

Plaintiffs filed a motion for additional time to respond to the pending discovery. Docket Nos.

26

30, 31. While that motion was pending, many, but not all, of the Plaintiffs provided their

27
1

28

By this time, the vast majority of those opt-ins have not worked for Defendants in years.

discovery responses. However, in an Updated Discovery Status Report filed on February 22,

2

2008, counsel for Plaintiffs indicated that they “have been unable to secure discovery responses”

3

from several of the Plaintiffs, including Patrick Moxley, Damian Zentner, and eleven other

4

Plaintiffs, and would be seeking to withdraw as their counsel. Docket No. 36-2 at 2. On

5

February 29, 2008, Plaintiffs’ Counsel filed their motion to withdraw their appearance as

6

attorneys for Patrick Moxley, Damian Zentner, and nine other Plaintiffs, indicating that counsel

7

“have been unable to communicate with these plaintiffs, and, as a result, are no longer able to

8

prosecute their claims.” Docket No. 38 at 2, 4. However, that motion was denied for failure to

9

comply with federal and local rules. See Docket No. 42.

10

The Court subsequently granted in part Defendants’ previously-filed motion to dismiss

11

certain plaintiffs, thereby dismissing with prejudice the claims of eleven Plaintiffs who had failed

12

to prosecute their claims. Docket No. 43. That motion had been filed on December 19, 2007,

13

before the extended deadline for responding to discovery. Docket No. 25. Accordingly, while it

14

encompassed eleven of the Plaintiffs who later failed to respond to discovery, it did not involve

15

Plaintiffs Patrick Moxley or Damian Zentner. Id. The Order, therefore, did not dismiss the

16

claims of either of the delinquent Absent Plaintiffs. Docket No. 43. Apparently believing that

17

all Plaintiffs who had failed to respond to discovery had been dismissed from the case, the Court

18

deemed moot Plaintiffs’ motion to extend time to respond to discovery. Docket No. 44.

19

Plaintiffs never refiled that motion; nor did counsel ever refile their motion to withdraw as

20

counsel for Plaintiffs Patrick Moxley or Damian Zentner.

21

Now, nearly half a year after the extended deadline to respond to Defendants’ discovery,

22

Plaintiffs Patrick Moxley and Damian Zentner still have not responded to any discovery or made

23

any other attempts to prosecute their case. See Stegeman Decl. ¶ 3. The discovery period closed

24

on June 11, 2008, and the case is set for trial on August 11, 2008. Docket No. 23. Accordingly,

25

the Absent Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed with prejudice.

II.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41, a court may dismiss an action for want of

4

prosecution where the plaintiff unjustifiably delays in proceeding with his claims. Specifically,

5

Rule 41(b) provides:
For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these
rules or any order of the court, a defendant may move for dismissal
of an action or any claim against the defendant. Unless the court in
its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this
subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other
than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for
failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication
upon the merits.

10

Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). As the Supreme Court held in the landmark case of Link v. Wabash
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20

Railroad Co.,
The authority of a federal trial court to dismiss a plaintiff’s action
with prejudice because of his failure to prosecute cannot seriously
be doubted. The power to invoke this sanction is necessary in
order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases
and to avoid congestion in the calendars of the District Courts.
370 U.S. 626, 629-30 (1962).
In this case, the Absent Plaintiffs, Patrick Moxley and Damian Zenter, have failed to
respond to discovery that was propounded more than eight months ago, have provided no
explanation for failing to do so, have made no other attempts to pursue their claims against
Defendants, and have generally failed to participate in any meaningful way in this case. In fact,

21
22
23

their own counsel have indicated that they have not been able to communicate with the Absent
Plaintiffs and are not able to prosecute their claims. Dismissal of the Absent Plaintiffs’ claims is

24

therefore warranted under Rule 41(b). See Link, 370 U.S. at 629-35 (affirming district court’s

25

sua sponte dismissal of plaintiff’s claims for failure to prosecute); Henderson v. Duncan, 779

26

F.2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir. 1986) (discussing factors to consider in dismissing claims under Rule

27

41(b), including “(1) the public’s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court’s

need to manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendants; (4) the public policy

2

favoring disposition of cases on their merits and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions”).

3

See generally 9 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Practice & Procedure § 2369 at

4

614-25 (3d ed. 2008).

5
6

Indeed, as with the claims of the eleven Plaintiffs already dismissed from this case under
Rule 41(b), “the Absent Plaintiffs have made it clear that they no longer have any interest in

7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

resolving this matter at all” and “[i]t would be unfair to the Defendants to allow the Absent
Plaintiffs to continue to ignore the minimal requirements of their participation any further.”
Docket No. 43 at 3 (Order granting in part motion to dismiss certain plaintiffs).
III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants respectfully request the Court grant their

motion and dismiss with prejudice the claims of Patrick Moxley and Damian Zentner. In the
alternative, the Court should order these two Absent Plaintiffs to show cause why their claims
should not be dismissed.
