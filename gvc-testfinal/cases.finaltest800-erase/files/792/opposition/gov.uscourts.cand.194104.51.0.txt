claims based upon their failure to provide responses to discovery requests propounded by

2

Defendants. See Docket No. 47 (“Defs’ Mot.”). As Plaintiffs’ counsel have been unable to

3

communicate with Plaintiffs Moxley and Zentner, and therefore have been unable to prepare

4
responses to Defendants’ discovery requests or determine why these plaintiffs have not
5
6

responded to counsel’s efforts to contact them, see Docket No. 38, counsel’s ability to oppose

7

Defendants’ motion is limited. Nevertheless, the Court has not relieved counsel from their

8

ethical obligation to represent these plaintiffs by responding to Defendants’ motion. Under these

9

circumstances, Plaintiffs’ counsel respectfully requests that, should the Court be inclined to

10
11

grant Defendants’ motion, it issue either a show cause order or an order dismissing Plaintiff
Moxley and Zentner’s claims without prejudice.

BACKGROUND

14
15
16

On February 29, 2008, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for 11
plaintiffs, including Plaintiffs Patrick Moxley and Damian Zentner. See Docket No. 38.

17

Defendants did not oppose the motion to withdraw. The Court denied the motion, indicating it

18

would not grant a motion to withdraw as counsel without the individual plaintiffs’ written

19

consent. See Docket No. 42. As the motion to withdraw as counsel was predicated on

20

Plaintiffs’ counsel’s inability to communicate with Plaintiffs’ Moxley and Zentner (as well as

21
the nine additional plaintiffs for whom counsel sought to withdraw as counsel), counsel were
22
23

unable to obtain the signatures from Plaintiffs Moxley and Zentner necessary to re-file a motion

24

to withdraw as their counsel. See Declaration of Llezlie L. Green, (“Green Decl.”), ¶ 2. Nine

25

other plaintiffs subject to that motion were subsequently dismissed due to their failure to

26

complete ADR forms. See Docket No. 43.

ARGUMENT

2
3
4

Plaintiffs’ counsel indicated in their Motion to Withdraw that, despite repeated efforts,
counsel have been unable to communicate with Plaintiffs Moxley and Zentner. See Docket No.

5

38, at 4. As a result, Plaintiffs Moxley and Zentner have not provided responses to Defendants’

6

outstanding discovery requests, nor have they sought discovery from the Defendants. See Green

7

Decl., ¶ 3. Put simply, plaintiffs’ failure to communicate with counsel has prevented counsel

8

from actively pursuing their claims against Defendants. Id., ¶ 4.

9
10
11
12
13

Defendants’ motion requests, in the alternative to the dismissal of Plaintiff Moxley and
Plaintiff Zentner’s claims, an order to them to show cause why their claims should not be
dismissed. See Defs’ Mot. at 6. Dismissal of a plaintiff’s claim is a “drastic sanction.” Ferdik
v. Bozelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir. 1992). Issuance of a show cause order prior to

14
15
16

granting such a sanction is more appropriate under these circumstances. While a warning
regarding the possibility of dismissal is warranted where courts consider taking sua sponte

17

action, there is no express requirement that the Court warn plaintiffs of the possibility their

18

claims will be dismissed where a motion has been noticed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). See

19

Morris v. Morgan Stanley & Co., 942 F.2d 648, 652 (9th Cir. 1991). Here, however, as

20

Plaintiffs’ counsel have been unable to successfully communicate with the plaintiffs whose

21
claims Defendants seek to dismiss, the affected plaintiffs likely have not received notice their
22
23

claims are in jeopardy. See Green Decl., ¶ 5. In light of these unique circumstances, Plaintiffs’

24

counsel respectfully request that, rather than dismissing plaintiffs’ claims, the Court issue an

25

order to show cause to be served upon the last known address of Plaintiffs’ Moxley and Zentner.

26

In the alternative, as Plaintiffs’ counsel cannot assure the Court that Plaintiffs’ Moxley and

27

Zentner have, in fact, received notice of Defendants’ motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel request that any

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ counsel respectfully request the Court issue a

show cause order, rather than dismissing Plaintiff Moxley and Plaintiff Zentner’s claims at this

juncture.
