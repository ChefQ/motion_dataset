MOTION TO TERMINATE SUPERVISED RELEASE AFTER

COMPLETION OF ONE-YEAR OF SUPERVISION
PURSUANT TO TITLE 18 U.S.C. S 3583(e)(1)

NOW COMES, JOHN DAVID VEIVIA ("VEIVIA"), appearing pro Se, and files
this Motion to Terminate Supervised Release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§

3583(e)(1).

INTRODUCTION
The district court enjoys "broad discretion" when, after "taking into account a

variety of considerations, including the nature of the offense and the history of the
offender, as well as any implications for public safety and deterrence," it discharges a

defendant's supervised release. See United States v. Jeanes, 150 F.3d 483, 484 (5th Cir.
1998). "These [factors] are largely the same considerations the court must assess when

imposing the original sentence." [I]Id.

Case 5:10-cr-01089-FB Document 589 Filed 02/22/16 Page 2 of 6

Title 18 U.S.C.

§

3583(e)(1) states that: "The court may, after considering the

factors set forth in section (a)( 1), (a)(2)(B), (a) (2)(C), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), terminate
a term of supervised release and discharge the person released at any time after the

expiration of one year of supervised release ... if it is satisfied that such action is
warranted by the conduct of the person released and the interest ofjustice."

"claims of injustice or unfairness may be properly evaluated-- as one factor
among many-- under the broad and general directive of § 3583(e)(1)." Jeanes at 484-485.
However, the court must be "satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the
defendant and in the interest of justice." Id.
As the Supreme Court has noted:

[

3583(e)(1)] is the unequivocal provision for

ending the term of supervised release without the possibility of its redisposition or
continuation at a later time. Congress wrote that when a court finds that a defendant's

conduct and the interest ofjustice warrant it, the court may "terminate a term of
supervised release and discharge the person released," once at least a year of release time

has been served. Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 370, 146 L.Ed.2d
727, 738 (2000)

DISCUSSION
Movant VEIVIA respectfully asks this court to terminate his supervised release

term for his "conduct" while on supervised release and in the "interest ofjustice."

I.
VEIVIA has shown exemplary post-conviction adjustment and conduct in his

supervision responsibilities. He has fully complied with the court's express terms of

Case 5:10-cr-01089-FB Document 589 Filed 02/22/16 Page 3 of 6

supervision, including abstaining from drug use, fully obeying the law, and diligently
complying with the requirements of the Probation Department. VEIVIA has tried to live a

productive lifestyle by holding steady employment while supporting himself and his
family. VEIVIA has been selected for the Low Threat Caseload. This was due to his
fuiiy complying with the conditions of his supervision and the recommendation of his

previous probation officer.

II.
When evaluating his offense conduct, criminal history, and potential for further
crimes, VEIVIA believes this court can find that his further and continued supervision is
not required because he meets the criteria, as suggested by the U.S. Administrative Office

of the Courts, for early termination, which include: "law-abiding behavior, full
compliance with the conditions of supervision, and a responsible, productive lifestyle."
See Publication 109, p.37 (1993), U.S. Administrative Office of Courts. See also,

Publication 109, Chapter III, p.19-21 (2007 Revision)
VEIVIA meets all of the following suggested criteria from Publication 109 (p.20):
1.

Stable community reintegration (e.g., residence, family, employment);

2. Progressive strides toward supervision objectives and in compliance with all conditions

of supervision;
3. No aggravated role in the offense

of conviction;

4. No history of violence (e.g., sexually assaultive, predatory behavior, or domestic

violence);

Case 5:10-cr-01089-FB Document 589 Filed 02/22/16 Page 4 of 6

5.

No recent arrests or convictions (including unresolved pending charges), or ongoing,

uninterrupted patterns of criminal conduct;
6. No recent evidence

of alcohol or drug abuse;

7. No recent psychiatric episodes;
8. No identifiable risk to the safety

of any identifiable victim; and

9. No identifiable risk to public safety based on the Risk Prediction Index (RPI).

CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, premises considered, VEIVIA asks this court to terminate his
supervised release term early for the aforementioned reasons.
