GOVERNMENT=S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S
PRO SE MOTION FOR EARLY TERMINATION
TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FRED BIERY:
The United States of America by and through the United States Attorney for the Western
District of Texas and the undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, files this Response to
Defendant’s Pro Se Motion for Early Termination.
On January 18, 2012, this Honorable Court sentenced the defendant to 41 months in the
Bureau of Prisons, 5 years supervised release, and restitution of $150,713.28, after the defendant
plead guilty to Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. §1349 in a car
title washing scheme. After serving his sentence, defendant’s term of supervised release began
on April 25, 2014. Defendant now files a Pro Se Motion for Early Termination seeking to
terminate his supervised release. The Government opposes early termination.
The Government made contact with defendant’s supervising probation officer, Maria
Baez, in the Houston United States Probation Office. Ms. Baez reported that defendant is in full
compliance with his supervised release. However, of the $150,813.28 in restitution the defendant
was ordered to pay, defendant still owes $147,266.02. According to Ms. Baez, it is the policy of
the Houston Probation Office to not submit motions for early termination of supervised release.

Case 5:10-cr-01089-FB Document 590 Filed 02/25/16 Page 2 of 3

It is the Government’s contention that serving less than two years of a five year term of
supervised release is not enough. While it is most commendable that the defendant is fully
compliant, the massive amount of restitution he still owes warrants continued supervision to
ensure the defendant maintains employment so that monthly payments are made.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Government asks that the Honorable
Court DENY Defendant’s Pro Se Motion for Early Termination.

Respectfully submitted,
RICHARD L. DURBIN, JR.
United States Attorney
