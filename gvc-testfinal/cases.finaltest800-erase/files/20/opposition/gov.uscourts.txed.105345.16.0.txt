I. INTRODUCTION

In this patent infringement suit, plaintiff Lear Corporation ("Lear") alleges that
defendants TS Tech USA Corporation, TS Tech North America, Inc., and TS Tech Canada, Inc.
(collectively "TS Tech" or "defendants") infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,378,043 ("the '043 patent")
by making pivotal headrest assemblies and selling them to Honda of America Manufacturing,
Inc. and/or Honda Canada, Inc. (collectively "Honda"). It is undisputed that TS Tech sells its
pivotal headrest assemblies to Honda knowing and intending that Honda will install them in
various models of its vehicles and sell these vehicles throughout the United States, including
Texas.
TS Tech has now filed a Motion to Transfer Venue. TS Tech does not dispute
that venue is proper here; it argues only that the Southern District of Ohio is more convenient.
TS Tech's motion should be denied because relevant factors — including the infringing activity
taking place in, and plaintiffs' choice of, this forum — favor maintaining the case in this district.

II. ANALYSIS

A.

Defendants Sell Infringing Pivotal Headrest
Assemblies To Honda Knowing That Honda
Will Sell Them In The Eastern District Of Texas
For the purpose of this motion, this Court is to "accept uncontroverted facts in

a plaintiff's pleadings as true and will resolve any conflicts in plaintiff's favor." Langton v.
CBeyond Communication, 282 F. Supp. 2d 504, 508 (E.D. Tex. 2003)(citation omitted). The
Complaint states:
12. . . . [u]pon information and belief, defendants have been
making infringing pivotal headrest assemblies since least 2005
and then selling them to Honda Motor Co., Ltd. or a related
entity ("Honda") knowing and intending that Honda will install
these infringing assemblies in Honda vehicles and sell those
vehicles throughout the United States — including in the Eastern
District of Texas.
13. Defendants' infringing pivotal headrest assemblies are, at the
very least, used and sold in Honda's 2006 Honda Civic and 2007
Accura RDX model vehicles. Lear believes that Defendants'
infringing pivotal headrest assemblies are also currently sold, and
will be sold, in other Honda models.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 12-13, Dkt. #1.)
TS Tech has not set forth any evidence to controvert Lear’s contention that the
pivotal headrest assemblies at issue are intended for use and sale in the Eastern District of
Texas. Indeed, TS Tech admitted that the accused
products are in certain automobiles that are sold by Honda in
Texas. . . .

Honda then installs these car seats into certain Honda automobile
models that are sold throughout the United States, including in
Texas.
(TS Tech's Brief, p. 3.)
Based on the facts, it is undisputed that venue is proper in this district.1 As explained below,
these facts also reinforce that transfer is not proper.

C.

The Case Should Not Be Transferred
Pursuant To 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)
28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) provides that "[f]or the convenience of parties and

witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other
district or division where it might have been brought." While it "is within the sound discretion
of the district court to transfer a case," "[t]he burden rests on the defendant to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that a plaintiff’s choice of forum should be disturbed and transfer
is appropriate based on a balancing of relevant factors. [U]nless the balance of factors strongly
favors the [defendant, plaintiff’s] choice of forum remains intact." Mannatech, Inc. v. K.Y.C.
Inc., 2006 WL 2216033, **1-2 (N.D. Tex. 2006)(Exhibit 1, emphasis added, citations omitted)
The factors comprise "several private and public interest factors, none of which are given
dispositive weight." Advance Me, Inc. v. Rapidpay LLC, 450 F.Supp.2d 669, 675 (E.D. Tex.
2006)(citation omitted).

Venue is proper wherever TS Tech resides. 28 U.S.C. § 1400(b). TS Tech "reside[s]
in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c). A
forum has “personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers products into the stream of
commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State.”
Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1994)(citation
omitted).

It is undisputed that transfer is improper unless TS Tech shows that "the
transferee forum is clearly the more convenient forum." (TS Tech Brief, p. 4, emphasis added.)
It is not.

1.

The Private Interest Factors Favor
Maintaining The Action In This Forum
The private interest factors include:

(1) plaintiff’s choice of forum; (2)

convenience of the parties and material witnesses; (3) place of the alleged wrong; (4) cost of
obtaining the attendance of witnesses and the availability of the compulsory process; (5)
accessibility and location of the sources of proof; and (6) possibility of delay and prejudice if
transfer is granted. Mohamed v. Mazda Motor Corp., 90 F.Supp.2d 757, 771 (E.D. Tex. 2000).
As shown below, these factors do not show the Southern District of Ohio to be "clearly the more
convenient forum." On the contrary, the factors favor keeping the case in this forum.
a.

Plaintiff’s Choice Of Forum

As this Court has indicated in several recent decisions on this same issue, “[t]he
plaintiff’s choice of forum is neither controlling nor determinative, but is still a factor to be
considered. The plaintiff’s choice of forum, however, will not be disturbed unless it is clearly
outweighed by other factors.” Mangosoft Intellectual Property, Inc. v. Skype Techs. SA, 2007
WL 2008899, *2 (E.D. Tex. 2007)(Ward, J.)(Exhibit 2, emphasis added, citation omitted);
Mershon v. Sling Media, Inc., 2007 WL 2009185, *2 (E.D. Tex. 2007)(Ward, J.)(Exhibit 3,
emphasis added, citation omitted); Aerielle, Inc. v. Monster Cable Prods., Inc., 2007 WL

951639, *2 (E.D. Tex. 2007)(Ward, J.)(Exhibit 4, emphasis added, citation omitted). Lear
chose to bring this suit in the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. Accordingly, this
factor weighs against transfer.

Place Of The Alleged Wrong

TS Tech sells its pivotal headrest assemblies to Honda which, in turn, installs
these assemblies in its vehicles and sells them to consumers in the Eastern District of Texas.
(TS Tech’s Brief, p. 3.) TS Tech has induced infringement by Honda in the Eastern District of
Texas. As such, this factor weighs against transfer.
c.

Cost Of Obtaining The Attendance Of Witnesses
And The Availability Of Compulsory Process

At this point in time, neither side has identified any non-party witnesses who
would not be subject to compulsory process. Accordingly, this factor is neutral.
d.

Accessibility And Location Of Sources Of Proof

Because the “documents will need to be exchanged regardless of where the case
is tried [and] the documents will most likely be exchanged electronically,” this factor is entitled
to little weight. Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Metrologic Instruments, Inc., 450 F.Supp. 2d 676, 678
(E.D. Tex. 2006). Further, although the pivotal headrest assemblies will likely be required at
trial, shipping them anywhere in the United States is a trivial burden. Accordingly, this factor
is neutral.
e.

Convenience Of The Parties And Material Witnesses

TS Tech’s entire argument on this point is that allowing this case to proceed in
the Eastern District of Texas would inconvenience and cause great expense to the party
witnesses. (TS Tech’s Brief, pp. 7-9). As this Court has previously held, “the convenience of
the parties is accorded less weight in a transfer analysis than the convenience of non-party

witnesses.” Aerielle, 2007 WL at *2 (Ward, J.)(Exhibit 4).

Further, any inconvenience that may be suffered by the parties will be very
limited regardless of whether this case is tried in Texas or Ohio. There are several reasons for
this.
First, prior to trial the witnesses will be needed only for depositions. Typically,
party witness depositions are taken at a location that is convenient for the witnesses.
Accordingly, the parties will likely schedule depositions near the headquarters of their
respective companies.
Further, to the extent that the witnesses are needed for trial, it is certain that both
sides will have witnesses that will need to travel, regardless of where the case is tried. In the
event that the case is transferred to the Southern District of Ohio, as requested by TS Tech, not
only will Lear’s employees be required to travel, but TS Tech’s employees from its Canada
location will be required to travel as well. TS Tech has already identified one employee (Mr.
Randy Walsh) who would likely have to travel from Ontario, Canada to attend the trial. (TS
Tech’s Brief, p. 9).
Finally, TS Tech's argument regarding the center of gravity (pp. 10-12) is
inaccurate. TS Tech ignores the creation of the patented invention which brings Michigan into
play. With significant events in Michigan, Ohio and Canada, there is no single "center of
gravity."
In short, travel by the parties' witnesses will be limited during discovery, and will
be necessary for the trial regardless of where the trial is held.

Possibility Of Delay And Prejudice

As previously indicated by this Court, “[t]he Fifth Circuit has suggested that this
factor may be relevant in a transfer analysis only in rare and special circumstances and when
such circumstances are established by clear and convincing evidence.” Mangosoft, 2007 WL
at *3 (Ward, J.) (Exhibit 2, citation omitted, emphasis added); Mershon, 2007 WL at *3 (Ward,
J.)(Exhibit 3, citation omitted, emphasis added); Aerielle, 2007 WL at *3 (Ward, J.)(Exhibit 4,
citation omitted, emphasis added). TS Tech’s argument on this point is that this case is at such
an early stage that a transfer “would not hinder progress of the case or prejudice Lear.” (TS
Tech’s Brief, p. 12). TS Tech makes no argument that this is a “rare and special circumstance”.
Accordingly, this factor weighs against transfer.
g.

Conclusion: The Private Interest Factors
Are Neutral Or Favor Lear

In conclusion, all of the private interest factors are either neutral or favor
maintaining this action in the Eastern District of Texas.

2.

The Public Interest Factors Favor
Maintaining This Action In This Forum
The public interest factors include (1) the administrative difficulties flowing from

court congestion; (2) the local interest in having local issues decided at home; (3) the forum’s
familiarity with the governing law; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary conflict of law
problems involving foreign law’s application. Network-1 Security Solutions, Inc. v. D-Link

Administrative Difficulties Flowing
From Court Congestion

According to the U.S. District Court Caseload Profiles for 2006, the median time
from filing to trial for a civil matter in the Eastern District of Texas is 17.7 months, while it is
27.0 months for the Southern District of Ohio. (Exhibits 8 and 9 to TS Tech Motion to Transfer
Venue.) This factor, in combination with Lear's choice of forum, strongly weighs against
transfer.
b.

Local Interest In Having Local Issues Decided At Home

There is also a great local interest in having this case decided in the Eastern
District of Texas. TS Tech argues that “Texas has no compelling connection or public interest
in having this controversy decided there.” (TS Tech’s Brief, p. 13). That is not true. “The
admitted sale or distribution of allegedly infringing products or services in the Eastern District
of Texas is an event that is significant and relevant to the citizens of this district.” Mangosoft,
2007 WL at *3 (Ward, J)(Exhibit 2, citation omitted). Accordingly, TS Tech’s sale of its
infringing pivotal headrest assemblies to Honda who then sells them to consumers in the Eastern
District of Texas is highly significant and relevant to citizens of that district. Accordingly, this
factor strongly weighs against transfer.
c.

Forum’s Familiarity With The Governing Law

Because “[t]his Court is very familiar with the United States patent laws that will
govern this case...[,] [t]his factor favors [plaintiff].” Source, Inc. v. Rewards Network Inc., 2005
WL 2367562, *3 (E.D. Tex. 2005)(Exhibit 5, citation omitted); see also, Network-1, 433

intellectual property cases were filed in Texas in 2006, 114 were filed in the same year in Ohio.
(Exhibits 8 and 9 to TS Tech’s Motion to Transfer Venue). This factor weighs against transfer.
d.

Avoidance Of Unnecessary Conflict Of Law
Problems Involving Foreign Law’s Application

“Since this case will involve the application of federal law, this factor is
inapplicable.” Network-1, 433 F.Supp.2d at 801. Accordingly, this factor is neutral.
e.

Conclusion: The Public Interest Factors
Strongly Weigh Against Transfer

In conclusion, the public interest factors strongly favor maintaining the present
action in Texas. The overall rationale was aptly set forth in Advance Me, Inc., 450 F.Supp.2d
at 674, where this Court held as follows:
Texas has a definite interest in this litigation. The allegedly
infringing services have been provided to, and are currently
offered to, Texans. Texas has a strong interest in discouraging
injuries, including patent infringement, occurring within its
borders. As the plaintiff, [Lear] has a strong interest in obtaining
relief. It claims [defendants are] infringing its patent and seeks
an injunction to stop the alleged infringement. [Lear] chose to
file in this district reasonably expecting a prompt trial date and
swift, efficient resolution of the controversy. ... Like all states,
Texas has an interest in upholding the patent laws of the United
States. Texas, particularly given its technology sector, has an
interest in promoting commerce and scientific development,
which is promoted by the patent system and the policies it
embodies.
Together, these considerations outweigh
[defendants’] burden of litigating here.
Because all of the public and private interests are neutral or favor Lear, this
