MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE

Defendants TS Tech USA Corporation ("TST USA"), TS Tech North America, Inc.
("TST NA") and TS Tech Canada, Inc. ("TST Canada') (collectively, "Defendants'") respectfully
move the Court under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a) to transfer venue of this case to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ("SD Ohio").' As described below, the facts and
circumstances in this case clearly demonstrate that this case should be transferred to the SD
Ohio.

L INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Lear Corporation ("Lear" or "Plaintiff') brought this lawsuit against Defendants
alleging infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 5,378,043 ("the `043 patent'), which is directed to a
vehicle pivotal headrest. This lawsuit, however, has no meaningful connection to Texas.

Defendants file this motion to transfer to the SD Ohio because it clearly is a more convenient

 

' Also attached in support of this motion is the Declaration of Vito J. DeBari ("DeBari Decl."), and
the Declaration of Yasuo Kibe ("Kibe Decl."), the Vice President of Administration for TST NA.
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 2 of 15

forum and better serves this interests of justice. Some of the key factors that weigh heavily in
favor of transferring this action to the SD Ohio are the following:

0x00B0 The accused products - headrests for carseats - are not made, marketed or sold by
the Defendants in Texas. Rather, the accused headrests are made in Ohio or
Canada, and then are incorporated into carseats that are sold in Ohio to Honda of
America Mfg., Inc. or in Ontario, Canada to Honda Canada, Inc. Honda then
installs these carseats into certain Honda automobile models that are sold
throughout United States.

0x00B0 None of the parties in this case has any offices in the Eastern District of Texas
("ED Texas"). In fact, the only presence that any of the parties has anywhere in
Texas appears to limited to a single location that Lear has in El Paso - about as
far away from the ED Texas as you can get in Texas.

0x00B0 The key witnesses identified to date in this action reside and/or work either in the
SD Ohio, Canada or Michigan.

0x00B0 The "center of gravity" of the accused infringing activity in this case is in the SD
Ohio and in Ontario, Canada.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Lear alleges that the Defendants infringe the `043 patent by making the accused headrest
assemblies and then selling them to Honda Motor Co., Ltd. or a related Honda entity ("Honda"),
which then installs the assemblies in Honda vehicles sold throughout the United States.
Complaint at 0x00A7 12. Lear is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 21557
Telegraph Road, Southfield, Michigan 48086. /d. at 0x00A7 1. Lear's only connection to Texas
appears to be a single location it has in El Paso, Texas, according to Lear's website. DeBari
Decl. 0x00A7 1.

The Defendants are involved in the design, manufacture and/or sale of carseats. Kibe
Decl. { 2. TST USA is incorporated under the laws of Ohio and has its principal place of
business at 8400 East Broad Street, Reynoldsburg, Ohio, which is in the SD Ohio. Kibe Decl. 4
3. Similarly, TST NA is incorporated under the laws of Ohio and has its principal place of

business at 8458 East Broad Street, Reynoldsburg, Ohio. Kibe Decl. 4. TST Canada is a

-2-
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 3 of 15

Canadian corporation with its principal place of business at 17855 Leslie Street, Newmarket,
Ontario, Canada. Kibe Decl. { 5.

Significantly, none of the Defendants has a place of business in Texas, has any
employees in Texas or keeps any files in Texas. Kibe Decl. 7.6. Nor has any of the Defendants
previously availed itself of the ED Texas by bringing suit here. Kibe Decl. | 7. Rather, all of
TST USA's and TST NA's employees and files are located at their respective headquarters in
Reynoldsburg, Ohio, while all of TST Canada's employees and files are located at its
headquarters in Ontario Canada. Kibe Decl. {J 8-9.

In addition, research, development and testing activities relating to the accused products
were performed at TST NA in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, while the production and manufacturing
relating to the accused products are performed at TST USA in Reynoldsburg, Ohio and TST
Canada in Ontario, Canada. Kibe Decl. ff 10-11. Moreover, key sales and marketing decisions
relating to the accused products occurred at TST NA in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. Kibe Decl. { 12.

Thus, the Defendants' only connection to Texas is that their products are in certain
automobiles that are sold by Honda in Texas. Importantly, the Defendants do not make, market
or sell their products in Texas. Rather, the accused headrests are made in Ohio or Canada, and
then are incorporated into carseats that are sold in Ohio to Honda of America Mfg., Inc. or in
Ontario, Canada to Honda Canada, Inc. Honda then installs these carseats into certain Honda
automobile models that are sold throughout the United States, including in Texas. Kibe Decl.

it. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES.

Under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a), a court may transfer a civil action to any other district where
it might have been brought for the convenience of the parties and the witnesses in the interests of

justice. "The goal of 0x00A7 1404 is to prevent waste of time, energy, and money and to protect

-3-
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 4 of 15

litigants, witnesses, and the public against unnecessary inconvenience and expense." Shoemake
v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 233 F. Supp. 2d 828, 829 (E.D. Tex. 2002) (internal quotations omitted).
In a recent decision, the Fifth Circuit has made clear that a proper application of 0x00A71404(a)
requires that a transfer be ordered where, as here, the transferee forum is clearly the more
convenient forum:
When the transferee forum is no more convenient than the chosen
forum, the plaintiff's choice should not be disturbed. When the
transferee forum is clearly more convenient, a transfer should be
ordered.

In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 506 F.3d 376, 385 (5th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added).

Because venue would be proper in the SD Ohio, the "critical issue" in this case is
whether the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interests of justice favor transfer. Jn
re Horseshoe Entm't, 337 F.3d 429, 433 (Sth Cir. 2003). When deciding whether to transfer
venue, the court balances various "private" and "public" interest factors. Jn re Volkswagen AG,
371 F.3d 201, 203 (Sth Cir. 2004); Zoltar Satellite Sys., Inc. v. LG Elecs. Mobile Comm'ns Co.,
402 F. Supp. 2d 731, 735 (E.D. Tex. 2005) (Davis, J.). In the present case, the balance of factors

tips decidedly in favor of transfer to the SD Ohio.

A. This Action Could Have Been Brought In The SD Ohio

In patent infringement cases, venue is governed by both 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1391 (federal
question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1400 (patent infringement). For federal questions, venue
is proper in a judicial district (1) where any defendant "resides" or (2) in which a substantial part
of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1391(b). For purposes
of venue, a corporate defendant is deemed to "reside" in any judicial district in which it is subject
to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1391(c). In patent

infringement cases, in addition to being appropriate in the judicial district where the defendant
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 5 of 15

resides, the action may also be brought where the defendant has committed acts of infringement
and has a regular and established place of business. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1400(b).

In this case, TST USA and TST NA could have been sued in the SD Ohio because they
both are residents of the SD Ohio. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1400(b). Similarly TST Canada could have been
sued in the SD Ohio because it is subject to personal jurisdiction there' and thus "resides" in the
SD Ohio or the purposes of venue. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1391(c). Accordingly, Lear could have
originally filed this action in the SD Ohio.

B. Transfer Serves the Convenience of Both Litigants

In deciding whether to transfer a case, the court should consider the following factors
related to convenience, also referred to as the "private factors": (1) the plaintiff's choice of
forum; (2) the convenience and costs of attendance for party and non-party witnesses; (3) the
accessibility of sources of proof; (4) the availability of compulsory process; (5) the place of the
alleged wrong; and (6) the possibility of delay and prejudice if transfer is granted. /n re
Volkswagen AG, 371 F.3d at 203; see Shoemake, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 830-35; Barton v. Young,
144 F. Supp. 2d 685, 688 (E.D. Tex. 2001); Wolfe v. Ford Motor Co., No. 2-06-CV-38, 2006
WL 1788915, at *2-3 (E.D. Tex. June 27, 2006); Amini Innovation Corp v. Bank & Estate
Liquidators, No. H-06-1561, 2007 WL 1795855, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 20, 2007); Minka

Lighting, Inc. v. Trans Globe Imps., Inc., No. 3:02-CV-2538, 2003 WL 21251684, at *2 (N.D.

 

* TST Canada is subject to personal jurisdiction in the SD Ohio because (a) the accused
headrests it manufactures were designed for use in Honda vehicles and to meet U.S. safety
standards, (b) TST Canada knows that such vehicles will be sold by Honda in the United States,
including in the SD Ohio and (c) personnel from TST Canada periodically visit TST NA's and
TST USA's facilities in the SD Ohio to confer about technical and/or manufacturing issues
concerning the accused headrests (Kibe Decl. 7 14). See Fortis Corporate Ins. v. Viken Ship
Management, 450 F.3d 214, 222 (6th Cir. 2006); Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc.,
993 F.2d 528, 544 (6th Cir. 1993); Ohio ex rel. Dann v. Bulgartabac Holding Group, 2007 Ohio
6777, P19-P21 (Ohio Ct. App. 2007); see also Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. Royal Sovereign Corp., 21
F.3d 1558, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 6 of 15

Tex. May 23, 2003). Because all parties and their documents, key witnesses, and the "center of
gravity" relevant to the accused infringing activity are either in the SD Ohio or in locations that
are much closer to the SD Ohio than to the ED Texas, both convenience and the interest of
justice warrant transfer of this case to the SD Ohio.

1. No Deference Should Be Given To Lear's Choice Of Forum

The plaintiff's choice of forum will be given "close scrutiny" where, as here, the plaintiff
is not a resident of the forum. Shoemake, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 831; see also Hanby v. Shell Oil
Co., 144 F. Supp. 2d 673, 677 (E.D. Tex. 2001) (noting that "the usual deference accorded the
plaintiffs choice of forum is of minimal value when none of the parties reside in this division of
this District"); Acterna, LLC vy. Adtech, Inc., 129 F. Supp. 2d 936, 938 (E.D. Va. 2001) (noting
that "Plaintiff's choice of forum is not entitled to substantial weight because the [forum selected]
is not Plaintiff's home forum, but a foreign forum."); Lycos, Inc. v. Tivo, Inc., 499 F. Supp.2d
685, 692 (E.D. Va. 2007) (stating that "[T]he plaintiff's choice of forum is not entitled to
substantial weight if the chosen forum is not the plaintiff's "home forum,' and the cause of action
bears little or no relation to the chosen forum."). Here, neither party is a resident of Texas and,
as described herein, this action has no real connection to Texas.

Where, as in this case, the district chosen by plaintiff has little factual nexus to the case,
and other factors weigh in favor of transfer, the plaintiff's choice of forum is accorded less
deference. Ray Mart, Inc. v. Stock Bldg. Supply of Tex., L.P., 435 F. Supp. 2d 578, 594 (E.D.
Tex. 2005). Moreover, in patent infringement cases, "the mere existence of limited sales activity
within [the forum state] does not require [the] court to give the plaintiff's choice of forum
substantial weight when balancing the convenience and justice factors." Lycos, 499 F. Supp. 2d
at 692; see Acterna, 129 F. Supp. 2d at 939 (affording the plaintiffs choice of forum only "very

slight weight" where the defendant's sales were not "unique to [the forum]"); Fuji Photo Film

-6-
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 7 of 15

Co., Ltd. v. Lexar Media, Inc., 415 F. Supp. 2d 370, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("Where a party's
products are sold in many states, sales alone are insufficient to establish a material connection to
the forum and to override other factors favoring transfer."); Original Creatine Patent Co., Ltd. v.
Met-Rx USA, Inc., 387 F. Supp. 2d 564, 568 (E.D. Va. 2005) (stating that federal courts are not
to give substantial weight to plaintiff's choice of forum when the only connection to the forum is
limited sales activity). As described above, none of the Defendants actually is selling the
accused products in Texas, and Honda's sales of automobiles incorporating the accused products
are not unique to Texas. Kibe Decl. { 13.

Accordingly, because none of the parties in this case is a resident of this forum and this
case has no meaningful connection to Texas, no deference should be given to Lear's choice of
forum.

2. Convenience and Cost Savings to the Parties and Witnesses Favor
Transfer to the SD Ohio

The most significant factor in venue transfer analysis is the convenience of the party and
non-party witnesses. Ray Mart, Inc., 435 F. Supp. 2d 590-91. "[V]enue is considered
convenient in the district or division where the majority of witnesses are located." Shoemake,
233 F. Supp. 2d at 832; see In re Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 204-05; Minka Lighting, 2003 WL
21251684 at *2.

"The logical starting point for analyzing convenience is to consider the parties'
residences." Robertson v. Kiamichi R.R. Co., 42 F. Supp. 2d 651, 657 (E.D. Tex. 1999).
Defendants TST USA and TST NA both are located in the SD Ohio. Although TST Canada is
headquartered in Ontario, Canada, it is significantly closer to the SD Ohio (about 460 miles
away) than it is to the ED of Texas (about 1380 miles away). DeBari Decl. {J 2-3. Similarly,

Lear's headquarters in Southfield, Michigan also is significantly closer to the SD Ohio (about
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 8 of 15

215 miles away) than it is to the ED of Texas (about 1100 miles away). DeBari Decl. [J 4-5.
Thus, there is no question that the SD Ohio would be more convenient than the ED Texas for all
the parties in this case. See In re Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 204-05; Minka, 2003 WL 21251684,
at *2.0x00B0

All of TST USA's and TST NA's employees are based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, while all
of TST Canada's employees are based in Ontario, Canada. Thus, the SD Ohio certainly is a
much more convenient form than the ED Texas for TST USA's and TST NA's employees, all of
whom are located in the SD Ohio. The SD Ohio also is more convenient than the ED Texas for
the TST Canada employees, since the ED Texas is more than 900 miles farther away than the SD
Ohio.

Notably, the burden associated with travel to a distant forum is an important
consideration in the transfer analysis. See In re Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 204-05. Several of the
Defendants' employees will undoubtedly be involved in this litigation, including providing
testimony at trial. Defendants' employees likely will be required to testify on various issues
including design, testing, research, production, sales and marketing of the accused products. For
example, Mr. Daikatsu Sato, TST NA's Senior Vice President of Research and Development,
likely would testify regarding the design, prototyping and testing of the accused products. Kibe
Decl. 4.15. Also, Mr. Scott Hepner, TST NA's Vice President of its International Business
Division, likely would testify regarding sales and customer communications concerning the

accused products. Kibe Decl. 4 16. From TST USA, Mr. Jeff Daniels, Vice President and Plant

 

* While Lear can stipulate that it does not find the ED Texas inconvenient, the fact remains that the
SD Ohio is nearly 900 miles closer to Lear's headquarters, and thus is a more convenient forum than
the ED Texas. See Shoemake, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 832 (noting that "despite his stipulation waiving
any inconvenience, the fact remains that the Federal courthouse in Lake Charles is approximately
thirty-five (35) miles closer to the [plaintiff's] residence than the Beaumont courthouse."').
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 9 of 15

Manager likely would testify regarding the production and manufacturing of the accused
products at TST USA's facilities in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. Kibe Decl. 7 17. In addition, the Plant
Manager at TST Canada, Mr. Randy Walsh, likely would testify regarding the production and
manufacturing of the accused products at TST Canada's facilities in Ontario, Canada. Kibe
Decl. 7 18.

Key Lear employees who will be important material witnesses in this case include the
three named inventors of the `034 patent, David C. Viano, Richard J. Neely and Mladen Humer.*
Messrs. Viano, Neely and Humer are likely to have substantial knowledge regarding the
development of the claimed invention of the `043 patent, the prior art relevant to the claimed
invention and the prosecution of the `043 patent.

By having to travel to Texas to testify, the parties' employees will be subject to increased
travel burdens, longer absences from family and personal obligations, and longer absences from
work than if the trial were held in the SD Ohio. These increased burdens are an important
consideration in the transfer analysis. See In re Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 204-05 ("[w]hen the
distance between an existing venue for trial of a matter and a proposed venue under 0x00A71404(a) is
more than 100 miles, the factor of inconvenience to witnesses increases in direct relationship to
the additional distance to be traveled."). Accordingly, the convenience of the parties and likely

party witnesses favors transfer to the SD Ohio.

 

* TS Tech has assumed for purposes of this motion that the three named inventors of the `034 patent
are employees of Lear. If, however, any of the named inventors in fact is not an employee of Lear
but instead 1s a non-party witness, this fact would further support and strengthen the arguments in
favor of transferring this case to the SD Ohio. Specifically, since all three named inventors reside in
Michigan at locations that are about 900 miles farther away from the ED Texas than from the SD
Ohio (DeBari Decl. J 6-7), the SD Ohio would be a much more convenient forum for them, and
even greater weight should be accorded to their convenience as non-party witnesses. Ray Mart, Inc.,
435 F. Supp. 2d at 591 ("[I]t is the convenience of non-party witnesses, rather than of party
witnesses, that is more important and is accorded greater weight in a transfer of venue analysis.").
Case 2:07-cv-00406-TJW Document 10 Filed 12/27/07 Page 10 of 15

3. The Accessibility of Proof Favors the SD Ohio

In addition to witnesses, documentary proof and other evidence (e.g., product samples)
relating to Lear's claims and the Defendants' defenses are located where the companies reside -
i.e., in Reynoldsburg, Ohio (TST USA and TS NA), Ontario, Canada (TST Canada) and
Southfield, Michigan (Lear). Since these locations are either in the SD Ohio or substantially
closer to the SD Ohio than to the ED Texas, the burden associated with accessing and, if
necessary, transporting that evidence will be greater if the case remains in ED Texas."
Therefore, this factor also weighs in favor of transfer.

4, The Availability Of Compulsory Process Currently Is A Neutral
Factor

The Defendants currently have not identified any non-party witnesses who would not be
subject to compulsory process in this case. Accordingly, this factor currently is neutral.

5. This Dispute Centers on Activities in the SD Ohio and Canada

Because patent infringement suits generally focus on the activities of the alleged
infringer, its employees, and its products, "the location of the alleged infringer's principal place
of business, therefore, is often the critical and controlling consideration in adjudicating a motion
to transfer venue. Minka Lighting, 2003 WL 21251684, at *3. Accordingly, "[i]n a patent
infringement action, the preferred forum is that which is the center of gravity of the accused
activity. /d.; Amini Innovation, 2007 WL 1795855 at *4; Acterna, 129 F. Supp. 2d at 939. In

addition, Texas district courts, as well as other federal courts have noted that "[t]he trier of fact

 

> For example, the product samples in this case are automobile seats that incorporate the accused
headrests and weigh approximately 40 pounds each. Moreover, since the accused products made
by TST Canada also are made by TST USA, all the relevant product samples in this case can be
found at TST USA's facilities in the SD Ohio. Kibe Decl. 4 19. Thus, the burden associated with
accessing and transporting the product samples in this case would be much greater in the ED Texas
than it would be in the SD Ohio.
