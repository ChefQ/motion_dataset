PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that counsel for Kolon Industries, Inc. (“Kolon”)1 hereby seek
leave of the Court to appear specially on Kolon’s behalf to file a motion to quash the purported
service of the summons and to dismiss the Superseding Indictment for lack o2f personal
jurisdiction. This Motion is made on the grounds that the Court has the authority to, and should,
grant the request for leave to appear specially to file a motion contesting service of the summons
on Kolon, without waiving Kolon’s objections to the service of the summons and/or to whether
this Court has personal jurisdiction over Kolon.
A Memorandum in support of the Motion is filed herewith.

1

“Kolon” refers to Kolon Industries, Inc. and any Kolon entity that the Government contends is
both a party and was properly served with process in the above-captioned action. As discussed
in the Motion to Quash, the Superseding Indictment is fatally ambiguous as to the named
defendant(s); however, to the extent any particular Kolon entity is found to be a proper
defendant, this Motion and the Motion to Quash extend to each such entity.
