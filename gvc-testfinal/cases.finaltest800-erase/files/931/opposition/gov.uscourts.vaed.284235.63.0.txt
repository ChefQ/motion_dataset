RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR LEAVE TO ENTER LIMITED
AND SPECIAL APPEARANCES ON BEHALF OF KOLON INDUSTRIES, INC. AND
APPLICATIONS OF JEFFREY GRAHAM RANDALL, KATHLEEN H. GOODHART,
AND STEPHEN C. NEAL TO QUALIFY AS FOREIGN ATTORNEYS
The United States of America, by and through the undersigned attorneys, respectfully
submits this opposition to the Motion for Leave to Enter Limited and Special Appearances on
Behalf of Kolon Industries, Inc. (Dkt. No. 60) (June 3, 2013) (hereinafter “Motion”) and the
Applications of Jeffrey Graham Randall, Kathleen H. Goodhart, and Stephen C. Neal to Qualify
as Foreign Attorney Under Local Criminal Rule 57.4 for the Limited Purposes of Challenging
this Court’s Jurisdiction, Service of a Summons on the Superseding Indictment, and Issuance of
a Subpoena in the Above-Captioned Case (Dkt. Nos. 56, 58, and 59) (June 3, 2013) (hereinafter
“Applications”).

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 2 of 10 PageID# 2244

I.

Background
The first indictment in this case named Kolon Industries, Inc. and several of its

employees as defendants. The United States did not oppose the motion of Kolon Industries, Inc.
to specially appear, through Mr. Randall and Mr. Neal among others, for the purpose of raising
jurisdictional objections and challenging service of process.
After four rounds of briefing and extensive oral argument, this Court held that Kolon
Industries, Inc. had not been properly served because service of the summons in Korea pursuant
to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (“MLAT”) occurred after the first arraignment date.
Memorandum Opinion (Dkt. No. 44) (February 22, 2013). In reaching this conclusion, the Court
unequivocally held that Kolon Industries, Inc. was subject to its jurisdiction if timely and
properly served. In particular, the Court: (1) rejected the argument that the “mailing
requirement” of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(c)(3)(C) was jurisdictional in nature, id. at
7-14; (2) rejected the argument that criminal summonses can only be served within the
jurisdiction of the United States pursuant to Rule 4(c)(2), id. at 49-51; and (3) held that personal
jurisdiction would attach either upon compliance with the “delivery requirement” of Criminal
Rule 4(c)(3)(C), id. at 11, or upon timely service pursuant to the MLAT, id. at 11 n.4 & 51. The
Court then ordered the United States to cause a new summons to be served through the MLAT.
Id. at 58-59.
Following the Court’s ruling, the Grand Jury returned a superseding indictment. The
superseding indictment alleged that, following the commission of the crimes alleged therein, the
original Kolon Industries, Inc. underwent a corporate reorganization resulting in the creation of a
new company, also named Kolon Industries, Inc., and the conversion of the old company into a
holding company named Kolon Corporation. Superseding Indictment at ¶11 (Dkt. No. 46)

2

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 3 of 10 PageID# 2245

(March 19, 2013). The superseding indictment named both post-reorganization entities as
successors to the original Kolon Industries, Inc., and listed both entities in the case caption. Id.
at page 1 and ¶11.
On May 8, 2013, summonses were timely served upon the new Kolon Industries, Inc. and
upon Kolon Corporation at their joint headquarters in Korea. Both summonses were accepted by
an office clerk/employee at the joint headquarters. See Exhibit 2 to Notice of Service of Process
upon Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation (Dkt. No. 52-2) (May 30, 2013). In addition,
on May 8, 2013, corporate summonses were served in the same manner upon the Chief
Executive Officers of both entities. See id.
II.

Analysis
The United States opposes the Motion and the Applications because there is no colorable

basis for challenging this Court’s jurisdiction or service of process in light of this Court’s prior
ruling on the subject. The United States has caused Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon
Corporation to be served in precisely the same manner as Kolon Industries, Inc. was served last
time, except that this time service was timely. The United States also has caused service to occur
upon the Chief Executive Officers of both companies. Finally, the United States has filed returns
of service with the clerk’s office. See Returns of Summons on Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon
Corporation (Dkt. Nos. 53 & 54) (May 30, 2013). On this record, any limited appearance to
contest jurisdiction or challenge process would necessarily entail relitigating issues that have
already been decided by this Court. Granting the Application under such circumstances would
not be in the interests of justice, as it would permit the movants to further delay their appearance
for trial.

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 4 of 10 PageID# 2246

The purported Memorandum in Support of Specially-Appearing Defendant Kolon
Industries, Inc.’s Motion to Quash Service and to Dismiss The Superseding Indictment (Dkt. No.
61-1) (June 3, 2013) (hereinafter “Memorandum”), confirms that the movants largely seek to
relitigate issues already decided by this Court. Thus, the movants again argue that Rule 4(c)(2)
and the “mailing requirement” of Rule 4(c)(3)(C) insulate foreign corporations from service of
criminal process, that the MLAT does not create an independent basis for service, and that
proposed amendments to the Criminal Rules seeking to ensure that foreign corporations cannot
avoid service through misconstruction of the current rules have the perverse effect of supporting
such a misconstruction. See id. at 7-27. All of these arguments have already been heard and
rejected by this Court.
Movants indicate they wish to bring new authorities to the Court’s attention and provide
instructive legislative history that was missing from the prior briefings. However, the principal
new authority relied on by the movants, a Memorandum to the Advisory Committee on Criminal
Rules dated March 25, 2103, provides as follows:
A review of the materials related to service of process on foreign entities suggests
that the original intent of the mailing requirement in both the Civil and Criminal
Rules was to address the problem that service of certain statutorily appointed
agents, such as the Secretary of State, would not immediately put a foreign entity
on notice or ensure its immediate receipt of process or documents.
Exhibit 1 to the Memorandum at 311. This lends no support to the movants argument, and in
fact suggests that noncompliance with the mailing requirement should not invalidate service
where the corporation was served directly rather than through a statutorily created agent.
Contrary to the movants’ claim of unearthing helpful legislative history, this
memorandum also concedes that there is no legislative history explaining why the mailing
requirement was expanded in 2002 to apply to all cases of criminal service of process. See id. at

4

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 5 of 10 PageID# 2247

310 (“Unfortunately, the Administrative Office has been unable to discover any materials
shedding additional light on the Committee’s deliberations or the reason it extended the mailing
requirement to all cases in which a summons is served on a corporation.”).1
The only other new authority cited by the movants is a district court from the Northern
District of California that distinguishes this Court’s opinion in very cursory fashion, without
consideration of any authorities that were not available to this Court when it issues its opinion.
See United States v. Panang Group Co., Ltd. at 9-10 (Exhibit 2 to the Memorandum). The
United States submits that it is exceedingly unlikely that this Court would abandon its previous
findings on the basis of such new materials.
The only novel argument raised by the movants is that the superseding indictment should
be quashed because it is ambiguous as to the identity of the corporate defendants. Id. at 27-30.
This argument is curious at best, since the ambiguity in the name Kolon Industries, Inc. is the
direct result of the movants choice to shift an old name onto a new company, and continue the
operation of the remainder of the old company under a new name, after the old company became
the subject of a civil lawsuit and a criminal investigation. This choice by the movants
necessitates that the United States prove in this case that the original Kolon Industries, Inc.
committed the charged crimes from 2002 through 2009, and that—as a matter of law—the new
Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation must answer for those crimes. That is precisely
1

Indeed, of all the available legislative history on the 2002 amendments, there are only two
pertinent bits of information, neither of which answer the question whether the mailing
requirement is jurisdictional. These are the observation in 2001 Advisory Committee Notes that
“in all cases in which a summons is being served on an organization, a copy of the summons
must be mailed to the organization,” and the observation in the same document that the removal
of the more limited mailing requirement from old Rule 9 (which would not have required a
mailing in this case) was “intended to be stylistic only” and that “[t]he language in current Rule
9(c)(1), concerning service of a summons on an organization, has been moved to Rule 4.”

(last accessed June 4, 2013).
5

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 6 of 10 PageID# 2248

what the superseding indictment provides. The ambiguity argument also fails because the
allegations regarding the corporate reorganization in the superseding indictment are based
directly on a statement that the old Kolon Industries, Inc. made to this Court through its counsel
in an ongoing civil case. See Statement to the Court on Corporate Transactions Involving Kolon
Corporation, E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company v. Kolon Industries, Inc., E.D.Va. No. 3:09cv-58 (Dkt. No. 1755) (Dec. 13, 2011) (“In October 2009, the board recommended a transaction,
approved by the shareholders effective December 31, 2009, to ‘spin off’ the industrial
manufacturing operations and assets (including Heracron) into a newly-formed public company,
which adopted the English name ‘Kolon Industries, Inc.’, while Original Kolon Industries
retained the investment assets and portfolio management functions, adopting the English name
“Kolon Corporation.’ ”).
Most importantly, for present purposes, the movants fail to identify any compelling
reason why an ambiguity challenge requires a special appearance.2 The Movants cite no case,
and the United States in not aware of any, permitting a limited appearance for purposes of raising
an ambiguity challenge to an indictment. If these entities believe the superseding indictment is
ambiguous, they should appear to be arraigned and move the Court for whatever relief they deem
proper at that time, rather than seeking leave for a special appearance.
2

The movants’ claim that they cannot tell whether the summonses are directed to the entities
existing today or the original Kolon Industries is simply fallacious, as they themselves concede
that “if the Government intended to name Old [Kolon Industries, Inc.] as a defendant, then it
knowingly used the wrong name in the Summons, since it concedes that Old [Kolon Industries,
Inc.] . . . now goes by the name Kolon Corporation.” See Memorandum in Support of SpeciallyAppearing Defendant Kolon Industries, Inc.’s Motion to Quash Service and to Dismiss The
Superseding Indictment at 29 (Dkt. No. 61-1) (June 3, 2013). Moreover, common sense dictates
that the United States cannot go back in time to serve the old Kolon Industries, Inc., so it has
served the currently existing companies—the new Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon
Corporation—and will prosecute them for the conduct of the predecessor entity. Hence the case
and summons caption naming “Kolon Industries, Inc., [i]ncluding and through its successors
‘Kolon Industries, Inc.’ and ‘Kolon Corporation.’ ”
6

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 7 of 10 PageID# 2249

The United States also opposes the Motion and Applications because they entail an
apparent conflict of interest. The Motion and Application all seek an appearance “on behalf of
Kolon Industries, Inc. and any other entity that the Government contends is both a party and was
properly served with process in the above-captioned case.” Motion at 1 n.1; Applications at 2.
As explained above, the superseding indictment names both the new Kolon Industries, Inc. and
Kolon Corporation as successors to the original Kolon Industries, Inc., and summonses have
been served on both post-reorganization entities. Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation
may have adverse interests in this case. For instance, each company may decide to argue
(though the United States would not agree with such arguments) that only the other company
bears criminal liability for the conduct of the old Kolon Industries, Inc.
Since Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation may have adverse interests in this
criminal case, the Court has a duty to inquire whether both companies consent to being
represented by the same attorney. See United States v. Tatum, 943 F.2d 370, 379 (4th Cir. 1991)
(“When the risk of a conflict of interest is brought to the attention of the trial court, however, the
court has the responsibility to investigate further, to advise the defendant personally, and to
receive a knowing waiver if that is the expressed wish of the defendant.”) (emphasis added). If
the Court is not satisfied that Defense Counsel’s representation would be conflict-free, then the
Court has discretion to refuse a waiver by the defendant, “not only in those rare cases where an
actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential
for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.”
Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 163 (1988) (recognizing that “the willingness of an

7

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 63 Filed 06/04/13 Page 8 of 10 PageID# 2250

attorney to obtain such waivers from his clients may bear an inverse relation to the care with
which he conveys all the necessary information to them”).3
In this case, the Court cannot inquire into any potential conflict with corporate
representatives of Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation unless they appear in Court,
which is precisely what the Motion and Applications seek to avoid. Therefore, the Court cannot
discharge its duty to advise the defendants personally of any conflict of interest unless the
defendants appear to be arraigned, at which time the Motion would become moot.4
III.

Conclulsion
The Motion and Applications should be denied because they seek to relitigate issues that

have already been decided by this Court, to raise an ambiguity challenge to the superseding
indictment that is not a proper basis for a limited appearance, and because the applicants have a
potential conflict of interest that this Court cannot fully explore without the presence of corporate
representatives in court.

3

The Court’s duty to inquire into a potential conflict arises even in a request for a limited
appearance, because Local Criminal Rule 57.4(D)(3) provides that “no pleading or notice
required to be signed by counsel shall be filed unless signed by counsel who shall have been
admitted to practice in this Court . . . and who shall have such authority that the Court can deal
with the attorney alone in all matters connected with the case.” (emphasis added).
4

The United States takes no position at this time as to whether the applicants (or any other
counsel) could represent both Kolon Industries, Inc. and Kolon Corporation after they enter their
general appearance and this Court has an opportunity to examine the potential conflict of
interest.
