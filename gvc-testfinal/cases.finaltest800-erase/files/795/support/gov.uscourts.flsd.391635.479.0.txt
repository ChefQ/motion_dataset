UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
MITCHELL J. STEIN,
Defendant.
____________________________/

MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT OR, ALTERNATIVELY,
FOR DISCLOSURE OF GRAND JURY MATERIALS,
FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND FOR A NEW TRIAL
COMES NOW, defendant Mitchell J. Stein (“Stein”), by and through the undersigned counsel,
and hereby respectfully moves the Court for an order dismissing the indictment or, in the alternative,
for disclosure of grand jury materials, for an evidentiary hearing and for a new trial, and as grounds
therefore states:
I.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Rule 33(b)(1), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, states:
“Any motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence
must be filed within 3 years after the verdict or finding of guilty. If an
appeal is pending, the court may not grant a motion for a new trial until
the appellate court remands the case.”

See also, United States v. Brown, 438 Fed. Appx. 871, 872 (11th Cir. 2011) (addressing divestiture of
trial court's jurisdiction during pendency of appeal); United States v. Fuentes-Lozano, 580 F.2d 724,
726 (5th Cir. 1978) (defendant may present motion for new trial “directly to the district court while
the appeal is pending,” but district court may not grant the motion until after remand).
Stein brings this motion to preserve the record regarding new developments in the case,

1

outlined below, that reveal additional evidence of prosecutorial misconduct and related violations of
law amounting to reversible error in the structure of this prosecution. 1
II.

INTRODUCTION
On September 28, 2015, the Government made certain admissions in its respondent’s brief in

the pending criminal appeal which wholly contradict some of its prior positions and prove its
knowledge of the falsity of the evidence it presented at trial, both of which – the falsity and
knowledge of that falsity – the Government has consistently disputed in prior proceedings. This is
significant with respect to evaluating these admissions in connection with the grand jury proceedings
in this case. While “[f]or Giglio violations, the defendant is entitled to a new trial ‘if there is any
reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury’”
(Guzman v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corr., 663 F.3d 1336, 1348 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing United States v.
Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 2397 (1976)), an error in grand jury proceedings which is
prejudicial to the defendant leads to dismissal of the indictment. Bank of Nova Scotia v. United
States, 487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S. Ct. 2369, 2373 (1988).
Further, an April 11, 2016 submission by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) in a related lawsuit reveals specific evidence that the prosecutors made false
statements to this Court when they represented that their investigation was “truly separate” from the
SEC's investigation and that the SEC was not part of the prosecution team. (DE46:8.) This newly
discovered evidence confirms that the two agencies (“prosecution team”) worked closely together in
both the investigation and prosecution of Stein, and that, accordingly – just as Stein has always
alleged – the SEC was an important part of the prosecution team.

1

On April 12, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals determined that oral argument will be
necessary in deciding Stein's appeal of his conviction and sentence, which is currently set for July 12,
2016 in Miami, Florida.

2

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 3 of 26

These findings, taken together, have significant ramifications and include the reality that the
prosecutors' violations of law in this case were structural in nature and that this Court should
seriously consider invoking the unusual remedy of dismissing the indictment. Notwithstanding their
obligation to search for the truth, 2 the prosecutors knowingly suppressed approximately 99% of the
prosecution team's files in filing a case they knew was untrue and in then conducting this litigation
by making false representations to the Court while egregiously violating Stein's discovery rights
under Rule 16, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963) and Giglio v. United States,
405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972).
Stein thus formally moves this Court to dismiss the indictment or alternatively to order a new
trial and disclosure of all grand jury materials, as well as an evidentiary hearing.
III.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. In the three motions for a new trial following his conviction, Stein maintained that the SEC
was a part of the investigative and prosecution team in this case and that, accordingly, the
prosecutors' conduct in not producing files from the universe of documents held by the SEC
mandates reversal under Rule 16, Brady and Giglio.

(See, e.g., DE279:21-30; DE308:11-15;

DE355:6-11 .) Stein also asserted that the prosecutors knowingly presented false evidence to the jury,
did not correct the falsity and instead capitalized on it in closing argument. (See, e.g., DE279:47-50;
DE312:17-23; DE355:11-12.)
B. Based in part upon the prosecutors' judicial representations that no Giglio violations had
occurred because the prosecution did not concede to any such violations (DE318:4-6), as well as the
prosecutors’ judicial representations that the SEC’s and DOJ’s investigations were “truly separate”
and that the SEC was not part of the prosecution team (DE46:8), the Court ruled that the motions for

2

Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1948 (1999).

3

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 4 of 26

new trial were “baseless” and “offensive” and that documents in the SEC database were never in
“possession of the prosecution team in this case.” (DE340:1; DE388:1.)
C. On September 28, 2015, the Government filed its respondent’s brief in the criminal appeal,
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Case No. 14-15621. (See, Exhibit C; highlighted for the Court’s
convenience.)
D. April 11, 2016, the SEC admitted that its files contain “Emails between SEC staff and staff
from the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) sharing information and analysis about parallel SEC and
DOJ investigations,” as well as at least four letters from the SEC to the DOJ regarding the SEC
records accessed by the DOJ for use in the Stein prosecution. (See, Exhibits A and B, SEC's recent
filing in FOIA litigation styled Mitchell J. Stein v. United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, District of Columbia Case No. 1:15-cv-01560-JDB (“FOIA case submission”) (D.C.
DE10-2:5-6; D.C. DE10-4:20,21,22); emphasis added.) Notably, the SEC has so far refused to list
individually on its Vaughn index what it estimated to be “thousands” of communications, including
inter-agency email communications, relating to its investigations and has thereby withheld the
authors and recipients of these communications although FOIA requires such details to be disclosed
to allow the reviewing court to test the claimed exemptions. 3 (Exhibits A and B (D.C. DE10-4D.C.
DE10-2).)
E. Evidence contained within the SEC's recent FOIA case submission further reveals that the
prosecution team in this matter conducted “settlement discussions” regarding key government

3

See, e.g., Vento v. I.R.S., 714 F. Supp. 2d 137, 156 (D.D.C. 2010) (agency failed to “indicate
why sender and receiver information was not disclosed for all withheld e-mails”); Wilderness Soc. v. U.S.
Dept. of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1, 15-18 (D.D.C. 2004) (“the relation between the author and
recipients” must be disclosed); Tipograph v. DOJ, 83 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D.D.C. 2015) (agency “must
conduct a document-by-document review in order to assign documents to the proper category”).

4

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 5 of 26

witness Martin Carter on August 11, 2009, 4 which – astonishingly – was six months before Carter
even testified before the SEC and more than two years before the indictment against Stein was filed.
(Exhibit A (D.C. DE10-4:5 [Vaughn index Doc.# 25]); DE3.) Thus, the government engaged in
settlement discussions involving Carter before Carter even committed the criminal act – alleged to
have been false SEC testimony – which he ultimately pled guilty to in the criminal action against
him. (See, id.; see also, Carter plea letter agreement GX225 [DE453-34]; see also, Ex. D at 9-13.)
Also remarkable is the fact that these settlement discussion plans were crafted four months before
Stein testified for the first time before the government in this investigation, regarding which Carter
testified four years later at the criminal trial in this Court that Stein lied during his SEC deposition,
leading to Stein’s conviction and a 17-year sentence now on appeal. 5 (DE435-30; DE244:112;
DE461.)

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
A. Fundamental Legal Standards
1.

Dismissal of the Indictment

“It is well established that federal courts have the inherent power to dismiss an indictment if a
sufficiently egregious case of [prosecutorial] misconduct is shown.” United States v. O'Keefe, 825
F.2d 314, 318 (11th Cir. 1987); see also, United States v. Holloway, 778 F.2d 653, 655 (11th Cir.
1985) (same). Outrageous prosecutorial misconduct merits dismissal of an indictment when it
violates “fundamental fairness” or is “shocking to the universal sense of justice.” United States v.
Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432 (1973).
4

Specifically, the document is described as “Draft for settlment [sic] discussions only of final
judgement as to defendant Martin B. Carter” (Exhibit A, Vaughn index Doc.# 25).
5

Notably, during this byzantine conduct involving Carter, prosecutor Kevin Muhlendorf was also
Senior Counsel at the SEC's Division of Enforcement. (See, Exhibits L and M.)

2.

Motion for New Trial

“Rule 33 allows a defendant to file a motion for a new trial within three years
after the verdict if the motion is based on ‘newly discovered evidence.’
Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). The court may grant the motion ‘if the interest of
justice so requires.’ Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a).”
United States v. Valdes, 580 F. App'x 852, 853 (11th Cir. 2014).
The newly-discovered evidence standard is not required in cases involving constitutional
errors such as discovery violations arising under Brady v. Maryland or Giglio v. United States. See,
United States v. Caro, No. 08-20044-CR, 2011 WL 4625383, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 2, 2011), aff'd,
589 F. App'x 449 (11th Cir. 2014) (“A court evaluating a motion for new trial involving Brady or
Giglio violations does not use the Rule 33 standard based on newly discovered evidence.”) (citing
United States v. Vallejo, 297 F.3d 1154, 1164 (11th Cir.2002); United States v. Cook, 170 Fed. Appx.
639, 640 (11th Cir.2006) (“district court erred because it evaluated [defendant’s] motion for a new
trial using the standard for a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence instead of a Rule
33 motion based on Brady evidence”); Ventura v. Att'y Gen. Fla.f, 419 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th
Cir.2005)); see also, United States v. Rivera Pedin, 861 F.2d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1988) (newlydiscovered evidence standard “is not applicable, however, where the Government's case included
false testimony and the prosecution knew or should have known of the falsehood.”) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).
3.

Discovery Errors

Substantively, any suppression of exculpatory evidence requires a new trial if there is a
reasonable likelihood it would have changed the outcome of the case. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S.
419, 422 (1995). Similarly, violations of Rule 16 are grounds for new trial, particularly if they violate
a defendant's fundamental rights. See, United States v. Rivera, 944 F.2d 1563, 1566 (11th Cir.1991);
United States v. Barragan, 793 F.2d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.1986); United States v. Noe, 821 F.2d 604,

607 (11th Cir. 1987); see also, United States v. Camargo-Vergara, 57 F.3d 993, 998 (11th Cir.
1995).
B.

The New Evidence
1. The Prosecution’s Admissions on Appeal

Stein respectfully incorporates into this motion as newly revealed evidence the Government’s
remarkable admissions on appeal in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Case No. 14-15621.
Certain of the Government’s admissions on appeal are crucial to this Court’s evaluation because they
are a complete departure from its position previously presented to this Court in a rather aggressive
manner, in opposition to Stein’s post-trial motions, calling his claims at the time “outlandish,”
“breathless,” “salacious but entirely conclusory and unfounded allegations” and maintained that the
“could have” standard could only be applied if the prosecutors conceded the evidence was indeed
false and that the prosecutors knew it was false at trial. (See, e.g., DE; DE318:1,19; DE318:4-6;
DE362:15.) These counter-attacks were followed by this Court’s finding that Stein’s motions were
“baseless” and “offensive.” (DE340:1.)
Some two years later, the Government’s positions on important issues Stein raised in this
Court and on appeal have changed completely and, indeed, constitute new admissions which render
some of its theories, at a minimum, illogical.
Among other things, the Government conceded for the first time on appeal that the Cardiac
Hospital Management (“CHM”) purchase order, which constitutes the beginning of the alleged fraud
period (DE428:211), was not “all made up” after all, but was indeed entered into by a bona fide
customer, Thomas Tribou, who made a down-payment on it. (Ex. C at 59 (RB at 43).) Its new theory
on appeal is that it was only “when Signalife could not ship any product to Tribou, Stein
‘orchestrated an elaborate scheme.’” (Id.) This new theory renders Carter’s trial testimony that the

7

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 8 of 26

purchase order was all made up by Stein because Stein made up all these names (e.g., “Cardiac
Hospital Management” (see, DE244:112-13)) wholly incredible, because Tribou is a real person who
signed the purchase order as “G.P.” of “Cardiac Hospital Management” long before the Government
now says Carter got involved in the “elaborate scheme.” (DE312-1:59-61.) If it is true that there was
a real purchase order but that “Signalife could not ship any product to Tribou” (Ex. C at 59 (RB at
43)), then, clearly, Signalife and its approximately seven executives who ran Signalife (DE241:176177,74-75; DX412:257-258 [DE46419:257-58]; GX93:100 [DE453-16:100]) (none of which the
Government called at the trial) must have been very much aware of its manufacturing problems in
connection with the purchase orders Woodbury testified were a “huge deal” for Signalife.
(DE240:97.) And if “Signalife could not ship any product” during this time, Signalife could not have
shipped any product to IT Healthcare either. 6 What is clear is that the Government used Carter’s
oblique testimony about Stein making up “all these names” (id.; see also, DE244:108) to argue to the
jury in closing argument what it now admits was false – that the CHM purchase order “never
happened.” (DE248:46-47 (emphasis added).)
An additional admission on appeal is its argument that “the jury was aware that some backup had been received for one of the purchase orders,” citing to a page in GX73:22 – a lengthy public
filing that mentions a down-payment on the CHM purchase order. (Exhibit C at 69 (RB at 53).) This
admission is harmful to the Government’s case and critical to Stein’s post-trial arguments, because
the Government now concedes it knowingly adduced testimony from its witness, John Woodbury,
informing the jury of the exact opposite of what it now argues on appeal, to wit, that Woodbury never
received “any additional independent information about these purchase orders” but that “[he] got all
[his] information from Mr. Stein.” (DE240:96; see also, DE240:9 (“… I had no independent
6

The two IT Healthcare purchase orders were dated around the same time the CHM purchase
order was dated. (GX70; GX74; GX64.)

8

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 9 of 26

understanding at all”).) Similarly, it knowingly adduced testimony from its witness Tracy Jones
specifically telling the jury that she “never received any backup or anything” on the purchase orders
which is why she fashioned them “phantom purchase orders.” (DE241:117.) Thus, the Government
now concedes for the first time that, at trial, it knew that these two witnesses were not telling the jury
the truth about the back-up they did receive in form of a $50,000 check by a bona fide customer
(which it identified in its respondent’s brief as “one piece of information” (Ex. C at 68 (RB at 52)),
yet they did not correct the false testimony but instead capitalized on it in closing argument.
(DE248:40 (“Remember Tracy Jones mentioned the phantom purchase orders.”); DE248:46-47.)
Again, in this Court, the Government did not apply the “could have” standard once in the post-trial
briefing on the basis that the prosecutors must first concede that they knew of the falsity. (See, e.g.,
DE318:4-5.) Stein respectfully submits that had this Court known of these recent admissions of
knowledge, it could not have reasonably summarily denied Stein's post-trial motions on the grounds
that they were “baseless” and “offensive.”
2. Grand Jury Errors Justify Dismissal
The Government's admissions on appeal establish that the grand jury proceedings were
tainted. One of only two alternative scenarios is possible: Either (a) the grand jury issued the
indictment based on false evidence, or (b) if the grand jury issued the indictment based upon the
wholly different theory the Government now adopts, Stein was tried on a theory that was never
submitted to the grand jury or approved by the grand jury. Under each scenario, dismissal of the
indictment is justified. In other words, Stein submits that whatever the disclosure of grand jury
materials may reveal, the Government’s admissions about the material variance in its core theories on
the CHM purchase order constitutes a fatal error mandating dismissal of the indictment.
More specifically, if the grand jury issued an indictment based on evidence that the CHM

9

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 10 of 26

purchase order was entered into by a bona fide customer and that the alleged scheme was the creation
of false change of address notices “when Signalife could not ship any product to Tribou” (Ex. C at 59
(RB at 43)) – a theory that significantly varies from the Government’s case before the petit jury
although the Government is now adopting this theory as the truth on appeal – then, undoubtedly,
Stein was “convicted on a charge the grand jury never made against him. This [would be] fatal
error.” Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 219, 80 S. Ct. 270, 274 (1960) (dismissing
indictment). Further, the indictment would have deprived Stein of proper notice of the specific
allegations, because it falsely alleges that
“STEIN and his co-conspirators inflated artificially the price and demand
for Signalife stock by misrepresenting Signalife's operations and
finances, including information regarding the sale of Signalife products.
Among other things[,] …STEIN and his co-conspirators created false
purchase orders….”
(DE3:3.) This allegation would be entirely false as to the CHM purchase order, according to the
Government’s appellate admissions, and would constitute a “variation [which] destroyed the
defendant's substantial right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a
grand jury. Deprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a
variance and then dismissed as harmless error.” Stirone, 361 U.S. at 217, 80 S. Ct. at 273.
Alternatively and perhaps more likely in light of the language in the indictment, if the jury
issued an indictment based on purported evidence which the Government now admits on appeal is
false – that the CHM purchase order was “all made up,” “never happened,” and was “fake” because
the customers don’t exist and these names were all made up by Stein – the indictment should be
dismissed because false evidence was intentionally placed before the grand jury, just as the
prosecution knowingly placed false evidence before the petit jury. United States v. DiBernardo, 775
F.2d 1470, 1475 (11th Cir. 1985) (dismissal of indictment warranted if “prosecutor intentionally

10

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 11 of 26

placed false testimony before the grand jury”).
The appellate admissions by the Government prove for the first time what this Court
previously found to be baseless allegations that the Government knew of the falsities presented.
These admissions are substantial and include the following statements on appeal:
The Government tries to persuade the Eleventh Circuit that “the jury was aware that some
back-up had been received for one of the purchase orders.” (Exhibit C at 69 (RB at 53).) Not only is
this statement a misconstruction of the record, as Stein pointed out in his reply brief with specific
record citations and as this Court knows, it reflects the opposite of what the Government endeavored
to prove at the trial. Specifically, with respect to GX73:22 cited by the Government in support of this
argument, the prosecutors adduced the false testimony from Woodbury that he never received any
independent information that would back up the statements on this page of the public filing he
submitted as the Company’s securities counsel, including the “back up” on one of the purchase
orders. (DE240:96.) Similarly, the Government adduced the false testimony from Jones that she
called the purchase orders “phantom” because she “never received any back up or anything on
them.” (DE241:117.) The Government admits now, however, that it always knew that both
Woodbury and Jones “received one piece of information” relating to the CHM purchase order (Ex. C
at 68 (RB at 52)); see also, id. (“in truth, Provencio forwarded Tribou’s check to Woodbury”)). The
Government did not stop there but even argued on appeal that the jury somehow therefore knew its
witnesses were not telling the truth about never having received one piece of information or back-up
of any kind. (Ex. C at 69 (RB at 53).) But in reality, the Government endeavored to prove at the trial
the opposite of what it now argues on appeal, to wit, that Tribou was not a bona fide customer under
the CHM purchase order (DE248:114 (“… where's Thomas Tribou's name? Does it say sold to
Thomas Tribou? It doesn't, ladies and gentlemen”)) and that the CHM purchase was Stein’s scheme

11

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 12 of 26

to create “fake sales that were helping to get the stock price up” (DE248:46) and that Tribou’s
purchase order “never happened” (DE248:46-47). Consequently, the Government deliberately and
repeatedly adduced testimony of what it knew to be false so that it could exploit these falsities in
closing argument.
The Government also argued on appeal that Jones and Woodbury may have had memory
problems about having received a copy of the $50,000 down-payment check. (Ex. C at 68 (RB at 52)
(Jones and Woodbury may have “simply forg[otten] that they received one piece of information” on
one of the purchase orders).) This, again, proves the Government always knew about the fact that
these witnesses indeed received a copy of Tribou’s $50,000 check as a down-payment on the
purchase order, whereas in this Court it both denied the allegation and perplexingly claimed that no
Giglio violation could possibly occur unless and until the prosecutors admitted the wrongdoing.
(DE318:4-6.)
Consequently, irrespective of whether the grand jury was told that the CHM purchase order
never happened or that it happened but that the customer never received his product, the error is fatal

12

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 13 of 26

in either scenario and requires dismissal of the indictment. 7
3. The Mounting Evidence of Prosecution Team
a. The Spirit of Collaboration
The newly disclosed evidence goes beyond the existence of a number of letters between the
agencies and thousands of inter-agency and intra-agency emails the SEC seeks to withhold.
Inconsistent with the spirit of FOIA, the SEC has refused to disclose even how many emails exist
between the SEC and the DOJ, and only vaguely estimated that it is withholding “thousands of email
messages” and “more than 5,000” files. (Exhibit E, at pages 4 of 7, 7 of 7.)
The SEC purports to have conducted a search exercise within thousands of emails included in
the “more than 5,000” withheld files using a limited number of search terms it selected for this search
(“Stein, Heart Tronics, Inc., Martin Carter, Willie Gault, J. Rowland Perkins, Mark Nevdahl, Ryan
Rauch, Yossi Keret, Tony Nony/Nonoy, Avi Cohen, Ari Cohen, or Marina Orita” (Exhibit B at ¶ 8))
among certain of the SEC attorneys (“Adam Eisner, Rachel Nonaka, Charles Cain, Stephen Cohen,
7

While Stein argues that dismissal is warranted at this point even without disclosure of grand jury
materials, disclosure of these materials could still prove to be beneficial to this Court’s evaluation. Carter
never testified before the grand jury (DE244:136-37), and it remains questionable that any hearsay
testimony could have possibly established any scheme regarding the purchase orders. While the
government is not required to “present all available evidence at [the grand jury] proceeding” (United
States v. Brown, 574 F.2d 1274, 1275 (5th Cir. 1978) (emphasis added)) and, even if disfavored, may
base its evidence before the grand jury on hearsay testimony (id., at 1276), a showing that the “integrity
of grand jury proceedings has been impaired” could justify dismissal of the indictment (id.). Notably, the
Second Circuit dismissed an indictment in United States v. Estepa, 471 F.2d 1132 (2d Cir. 1972), because
the witness that testified before the grand jury had no first-hand knowledge of the events. The Second
Circuit explained:
“We have been willing to allow ample, many doubtless think too ample,
latitude in the needless use of hearsay, subject to only two provisos-that the
prosecutor does not deceive grand jurors as to ‘the shoddy merchandise they
are getting so they can seek something better if they wish,’ … or that the
case does not involve ‘a high probability that with eyewitness rather than
hearsay testimony the grand jury would not have indicted.’ …”
Id. at 1137 (citations omitted). It is doubtful the grand jury was aware of the shoddy merchandise they
were likely getting with regard to the purchase orders.

13

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 14 of 26

Mark Lanpher, and Paul Gunson” 8 (id.)) and other government agencies (“U.S. Department of
Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Treasury, FINRA,
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of
Luxembourg, the California AG’s Office, and/or the Internal Revenue Service” (Exhibit B at ¶ 7)).
By executing this search, the SEC declared it located 2,715 files. (Exhibit B at ¶ 9.) Despite the
requirement to provide the district court in a FOIA action with sufficient detail to conduct a
meaningful evaluation of the claimed exemptions, 9 the SEC refused to even identify senders,
recipients and dates for those 2,715 files, and has thus refused to disclose how many of those emails
it located are “between SEC staff and staff from the Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) sharing
information and analysis about parallel SEC and DOJ investigations” (Exhibit B at ¶ 11); it could be
as many as 1,800 emails. Further, this excludes the remainder of those “more than 5,000” withheld
files from which it extracted the 2,715 files based on the criteria the SEC selected. (Exhibit E, at
pages 4 of 7, 7 of 7; Ex. B, ¶¶ 7-8.)
The SEC also made clear that it intends to withhold these files in perpetuity, meaning that,
while it originally invoked Exemption 7(A) in response to Stein’s FOIA request, because Exemption
7(A) is temporal in nature, 10 “[c]onsistent with the temporal nature of Exemption 7(A), at the
administrative appeal level the OGC advised Stein that it reserved the right to assert any other
applicable exemptions when 7(A) no longer applied to the requested investigatory records” (Exhibit
8

The SEC did not include all of the names of the attorneys involved in the investigation in this
search (see, e.g., Ex. K at bates-page 000008) and did not analyze all of the withheld files (Ex. B.)
9

Under FOIA, the agency must meet its burden of proof on any and all of the exemptions “in a
way that facilitates litigant challenges and court review of the agency's withholdings.” Judicial Watch,

F, at 10 (D.C. DE10-1:10, fn. 3)) and later also invoked Exemption 5 in its admitted effort to assure
that secrecy prevails with regard to thousands of unidentified emails. (D.C.DE10-1; D.C.DE10-4;
D.C.DE10-2 (Exhibits A, B, F).) This transparent strategy to effectuate the wholesale withholding of
thousands of unlisted and unidentified files is inconsistent with “FOIA [which] strongly favors
openness, as Congress recognized in enacting it that an informed citizenry is ‘vital to the functioning
of a democratic society, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to
the governed.’” Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing
N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242, 98 S. Ct. 2311, 2327 (1978)). The SEC is
even withholding the DOJ’s “access request” (Ex. A at 20 (D.C. DE 10-4:20, Vaughn Doc. # 185
(“Letter from U.S. Department of Justice to SEC requesting access to certain SEC records”);
DE146:41) and related communications on the basis that disclosure could somehow interfere with its
civil case now on appeal 11 after the C.D. Cal. entered summary judgment based on the alleged
collateral estoppel effect of the criminal conviction. (C.D. Cal. DE277.) The SEC also asserts the
DOJ’s access request is protected under the work-product privilege (Ex. A at 20), but “compilations
of documents that support the factual allegations of a complaint reveals no more than that already
revealed by the filing of the complaint” and are not protected by work-product doctrine. SEC v.
Collins & Aikman Corp., 256 F.R.D. 403, 410–11 (S.D.N.Y.2009). The SEC also maintains that
these thousands of files do not contain a single segregable portion of factual information.
(D.C.DE10-2:¶19 (Ex. B); D.C.DE10-1:27 (Ex. F).)
Consequently, the government's recent efforts to keep these files secret to avoid the
incommodious disclosure of the “strengths and weaknesses” of its case and investigation (Ex. F
(D.C.DE10-1:14,16)) contribute to the already established evidence that the SEC played a pivotal
11

The civil appeal, Ninth Circuit Case No. 15-55506 was stayed at the SEC’s request pending
resolution of the criminal appeal.

15

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 16 of 26

role in the prosecution of Stein. In the event the Court is not inclined to grant relief, logic suggests it
may wish to ask the prosecutors at an evidentiary hearing a simple question: “How many written
communications were there between the DOJ and SEC regarding the Signalife/Heart Tronics
investigation?”
b. The Carter Settlement Discussions
The Government is also expected to argue that the evidence of the withheld file described as
“[d]raft for settlment [sic] discussions only of final judgement as to defendant Martin B. Carter” (Ex.
B, D.C.DE10-4:5 (Vaughn index Doc.# 25)) is pure speculation because (a) the contents have not
been disclosed, (b) the context has not been disclosed, and (c) “as a general matter,” the SEC makes
“wholly separate … decisions” (DE46:5,8). Even irrespective of the contents of this curious
settlement-related document, it is clear that the SEC was crafting a settlement plan at a time
prosecutor Kevin Muhlendorf was its Senior Counsel, and that settlement plan was crafted prior to
the government's multi-year investigation and before anyone allegedly committed perjury before any
government agency in this matter, and crafted these plans as to one individual only –the
prosecution’s star witness and government cooperator Martin Carter. (Ex. B; D.C.DE10-4:5 (Vaughn
index Doc.#26); GX216; DE312-1:25.) Even if it were believable that the settlement discussions
pertained only to the SEC’s parallel civil case and not in any way to the criminal action, the SEC’s
own admission that its “plan all along was to move for collateral estoppel” if Stein were convicted 12
(Ex. G at 15 (C.D. Cal. DE326:15)) is important in considering the prosecution team’s preinvestigation motives and goals in connection with an early settlement with Carter. In other words,
12

Notably, the DOJ intervened in the civil action on April 3, 2012 to further assure discovery was
stayed in the civil action and also revealed its knowledge of the SEC’s intention to move for summary
judgment (Ex. H; C.D. Cal. DE36:18 (“conviction will operate as an estoppel”)). After the trial, the SEC
produced a nearly identical set of documents to Stein, in addition to approximately 45,000 pages of files
marked “SEC-Investigative” which contained, among other things, the thousands of pages of the trial
transcripts of the criminal trial and Exhibit X. (See, DE355-2; Ex. J.)

16

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 17 of 26

given that the SEC never intended to litigate its case against Stein at a trial but relied entirely on the
criminal trial for which Carter had agreed to testify that Stein committed perjury with respect to
making up “all these names” on the purchase order documents Carter created, what benefit could
flow to the SEC from an early settlement with Carter if not the agreed-upon cooperation in the
criminal case? And if no witness had yet testified at the time the SEC began developing this
stratagem, how could the SEC have even known what precisely the allegations against Carter were
which he would consent to with respect to the purchase order documents at the heart of the
investigations the government would pursue for years following the 2009 settlement discussions? It
arguably shows that the government’s intention to prosecute someone could very well precede any
alleged proof of wrongdoing by that person. In any event, it is simply not believable that the SEC
could have developed anything even close to the Consent Carter signed 13 at a time it had not deposed
a single witness and had not yet even obtained authorization to conduct an investigation of “potential
violations…” in this matter (Ex. B; D.C.DE10-4:5 (Vaughn index Doc.#26); emphasis added). These
revelations are critical, because they buttress the clear evidence that the SEC and DOJ prosecuted
this case based on inconsistent theories and proof. (Compare: DE428:34,46-47 (CHM purchase order
was “all made up” and “never happened”) with Ex. C at 59 (RB at 43) (purchase order happened and
was a legitimate contract).) Based on this due process violation alone, the conviction should be set
aside. Drake v. Kemp, 762 F.2d 1449, 1479 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding that prosecutor’s use of “totally
inconsistent ... theories ... was inherently unfair”); Smith v. Groose, 205 F.3d 1045, 1049 (8th Cir.
2003) (due process rights may be implicated by government’s use of factually inconsistent and
irreconcilable testimony in two proceedings against the same person).

See, Exhibit D; Carter Consent in the civil action laying out admissions about specific
wrongdoing about purchase order documents and Exhibit A thereto, laying out admissions of committing
perjury and frustrating the SEC’s investigation.

4. Cumulative Analysis
The newly disclosed evidence should be viewed cumulatively with the evidence previously
presented, because “[w]hat may have been a reasonable decision on the [earlier district court] record
may no longer be reasonable in light of the new evidence.” Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 215,
131 S. Ct. 1388, 1418 (2011); see also, United States v. Labarbera, 581 F.2d 107, 110 (5th Cir.
1978) (“cumulative effect of the errors . . . convinces us … that the defendant did not receive the fair
trial he is entitled to under the law”).
Stein submits that the now even clearer picture of the spirit of collaboration between the
DOJ and SEC and mounting evidence of misrepresentations to this Court and the petit jury, when
viewed cumulatively, clearly show that Stein was deprived of a fair trial and that the interests of
justice justify ordering a new one. Stein also claims that the errors in this case are structural in nature
and prejudicial and warrant dismissal of the indictment. (See, section IV.B.2, supra.)
As explained in section IV.B.3a, supra, the cumulative effect of the piecemeal leakage of
information about the extent the SEC and DOJ collaborated clearly establishes that the SEC was part
of the prosecution team far earlier than anticipated and possibly at the start of the prosecutorial
investigation. It also confirms that the extension of the DOJ’s discovery obligations to the universe of
documents in the custody of the SEC from which the DOJ essentially acquired its case and its files is
anything but “illogical.” ” (Ex. C at 73 (RB at 57).) This Court could now not reasonably come to the
same conclusion that it came to on or around September 26, 2012, when it ruled that “[i]t … cannot
fairly be said that the investigation was joint, that [the DOJ and SEC] collaborated extensively, or
that the SEC was part of the prosecution team.” (DE63:2.)
As to the two wholly different theories on Tribou’s purchase order, the new evidence of
Government admissions could only be viewed collectively with the prior record. The Government

18

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 19 of 26

never presented its acceptance of a wholly different theory in this Court, but instead insisted that
Stein’s claims were “completely without merit” and even “outlandish.” (DE298-1:1; DE318:18.)
Finding Stein’s claim’s baseless, this Court could not evaluate the reality of the Government’s
alternative theory of a real purchase order entered into by a real customer, which impacts the
credibility of Martin Carter’s testimony, impacts the Court’s assessment of the prosecutors’
representations about the $50,000 check after their off-the-record telephone call with Tribou
(DE247:54-57), impacts Stein’s discovery claims, impacts the loss enhancement calculations, and
even necessarily impacts the propriety of the grand jury proceedings as set forth herein.
This Court could now not reasonably come to the same conclusion it came to on or around
June 9, 2014, when it ruled that Stein’s post-trial motions were “not only baseless, but also
offensive” (DE340:1) and on or around November 25, 2014, when it ruled that “there has been no
showing that the prosecutors knowingly made false representations or presented perjured testimony
to the jury in this case.” (DE388:2.) It is respectfully submitted that there could be no stronger
showing of knowledge by the prosecution than the prosecution’s own admissions. (See, sections
IV.B.1 and 2, supra.)
5. The Evidentiary Suppression Justifies Relief
The evidence that the SEC was a part of the prosecution team merits serious consideration by
this Court in fashioning an appropriate remedy. The conduct by the Government now includes
knowing representations to the Court in order to effect nearly a wholesale suppression of the universe
of documents held by the prosecution team. (See, e.g., DE46:5,8 (“Department of Justice prosecutors
do not as a general matter have any authority over SEC investigative staff or access to SEC
materials…. Here, [the DOJ’s and SEC’s investigations] were truly separate investigations, which
led to separate and wholly different charging decisions” (emphasis added)).) That this type of

19

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 20 of 26

conduct is unlawful is long-ago settled law in this circuit. See, e.g., United States v. Trevino, 556
F.2d 1265, 1272 (5th Cir. 1977) (“Certainly the prosecutor would not be allowed to avoid disclosure
of evidence by the simple expedient of leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another
agency while utilizing his access to it in preparing his case for trial; such evidence is plainly within
his Rule 16 ‘control.’”). 14
At the outset of the case in response to Stein’s discovery requests, the prosecutors responded
that they were only obligated to produce those “documents and materials the SEC sent the United
States” (DE46:6,7, fn. 4) and that the two agencies conducted “truly separate” investigations in
which the SEC was not a part of the prosecution team. (DE46:5,8.)
On September 23, 2015, Stein sued the SEC after it refused to comply with FOIA after Stein
submitted a FOIA request for “all documents and information in the possession of the Securities and
Exchange Commission appertaining or relating to its investigation into any persons named Yossi
Keret, Tony Nony/Nonoy, Avi Cohen, Ari Cohen and Marina Orita during its investigation [in
United States v. Mitchell J. Stein; S.D. Fla. Case No. 11-80205 and SEC v. Heart Tronics, Inc., et al.,
C.D. Cal. Case No. SACV11-1962]” and all documents reflected on the privilege log the SEC
produced in the civil action. (Exhibit I.) On April 11, 2016, Stein and the SEC filed cross motions for
summary judgment (as commonly done in a FOIA action). This caused the SEC to have to submit an
explanation for its withholding of the thousands of files responsive to the FOIA request. While the
SEC still refused to submit the requisite details, more evidence of the spirit of the inter-agency
collaboration was revealed. (See, section IV.B.3a, supra.) As set forth above, the investigations were
not “truly” separate at all. Rather, the investigations were combined and the two agencies shared
their analyses directly with one another; indeed, the DOJ obtained most of its files in this case from
14

Pursuant to Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981), all decisions of
the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered prior to 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.

20

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 21 of 26

the fruits of the SEC investigation conducted at a time when prosecutor Kevin Muhlendorf was SEC
Senior Counsel.
Considering the SEC’s recent admission that it has located emails “between SEC staff and
staff from the Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) sharing information and analysis about parallel SEC
and DOJ investigations” in this matter (at least in connection with the search terms delineated at Ex.
B, ¶8 (D.C.DE10-2:¶8)), and its refusal to identify how many of the “thousands of [withheld] emails”
are such emails between the DOJ and the SEC (Ex. E, at p. 4 of 7; Ex. B.), Stein’s claim that it would
not be “illogical” (Ex. C at 73 (RB at 57)) to expect the DOJ to produce documents from the universe
of documents held by the SEC is perfectly logical. See, United States v. Naranjo, 634 F.3d 1198,
1212 (11th Cir. 2011) (disclosure obligation when agencies significantly “pooled their investigative
energies”) (citation omitted); United States v. Jordan, 316 F.3d 1215, 1249 (11th Cir. 2003)
(discovery obligations extend to “materials in the hands of a governmental investigatory agency
closely connected to the prosecutor”); United States v. Risha, 445 F.3d 298, 305 (3d Cir. 2006)
("close working relationship" between agencies sufficient to find prosecution team); United States v.
Auten, 632 F.2d 478, 481 (5th Cir. 1980) (finding suppression of “available information,” because
the prosecutor chose not to seek the information although he knew how to acquire it); United States
v. Antone, 603 F.2d 566, 569 (5th Cir. 1979) (relevant factors include the "spirit of cooperation"
between the agencies); United States v. Scruggs, 583 F.2d 238, 242 (5th Cir. 1978) (“government
[not] excused from its [discovery] obligation by the fact that the documents were in the possession of
the FBI prior to trial”); United States v. Deutsch, 475 F.2d 55, 57 (5th Cir. 1973) overruled on other
grounds by United States v. Henry, 749 F.2d 203 (5th Cir. 1984) (“there is no suggestion in Brady
that different ‘arms’ of the government … are severable entities”); United States v. Wilson, 237 F.3d
827, 832 (7th Cir. 2001) (“knowledge of evidence is imputed to the prosecutors only if it lies within

21

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 22 of 26

an agency that is ‘part of the team that investigated [the] case or participated in its prosecution’”)
(citing United States v. Morris, 80 F.3d 1151, 1169–70 (7th Cir.1996)); United States v. Bryan, 868
F.2d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 1989) (“prosecutor … deemed to have knowledge of and access to
anything in the possession, custody or control of any federal agency participating in the …
investigation”); United States v. Beers, 189 F.3d 1297, 1304 (10th Cir. 1999) (“[i]nformation
possessed by other branches of the federal government, including investigating officers, is typically
imputed to the prosecutors of the case”).
Having already pointed to significant evidence in the record that establishes that the SEC was
part of the prosecution team, which includes the DOJ’s admitted “access” to the SEC’s database
(DE146:41) as well as its admission that most of the files it produced to the defense came from the
SEC (DE46-1:2), in light of the SEC’s recent admissions, the evidence of the spirit of collaboration
is now overwhelming and cannot be reasonably ignored.
6. This Case is Akin to Structural Error
Although the doctrine of structural error applies to only a limited class of cases, 15 the impact
of the unique and far-reaching attempts to suppress the truth in this case raise a similar if not
identical kind of error. Suppressing nearly 200 million documents is clearly akin to structural error
when considered alongside what the government now admits were, at a minimum, inaccuracies in its
prosecutors' case against Stein. As the Supreme Court has instructed, “the touchstone of structural
error is fundamental unfairness and unreliability.” United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140,
159, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 2570 (2006).
The Government's admissions on appeal remove any doubt that Stein was prejudiced by the

15

Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S. Ct. 1827 (1999); Johnson v. United States, 520
U.S. 461, 468-69, 117 S. Ct. 1544, 1549-50 (1997) (listing limited class of cases involving structural
error).

22

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 23 of 26

foregoing misconduct. For example, the government now admits that key prosecution witnesses
Tracy Jones and John Woodbury may have “simply forg[otten] that they received” back up on the
purchase orders when they falsely testified that the purchase orders were “phantom” because they
never received back-up information regarding them. The truth is that they both received the $50,000
down payment on the CHM purchase order which was forwarded to “chairman of the audit
committee of [Signalife’s] board of directors,” Norma Provencio, who performed audit functions
relating to the purchase orders. (Ex. C at 68 (RB at 52); DE241:117; DE264-3:2; DE264-4; DE2641:2; DE266:11; GX73:39 [DE453-11:39]; GX93:93 [DE453-16:93]; DX412:11[DE452-117:11].)
Whether or not their false testimony is reversable error under Giglio and Davis v. Zant 16 will soon be
decided by the Eleventh Circuit, but what is not before the Eleventh Circuit is whether it was
fundamentally unfair for the prosecutors to consistently dupe this Court into believing the SEC was
not a part of the prosecution team as a method to avoid producing the relevant files from the SEC
database. We now know that the SEC was not only a key member of the prosecution team, but that it
actually assisted in analyzing the issues in the criminal case. The fact that the government now
admits that two of its key witnesses may have had memory problems is critical to the analysis and is
the hallmark of unreliability. Indeed, the fact that those purported memory problems pertained to the
core issue in the case -- whether Stein fabricated the three purchase orders -- is dispositive. Could
any one of the millions of suppressed files have refreshed their allegedly faulty recollections? Do
any of the millions of files of information reflect that there was indeed additional back-up for the
three purchase orders, thus completely exonerating Stein? It is important to remember that Tracy
Jones was the executive secretary for three Chief Executives of Signalife, yet the prosecutors only
16

Davis v. Zant, 36 F.3d 1538, 1548 (11th Cir. 1994) (“Little time and no discussion is necessary
to conclude that it is improper for a prosecutor to use misstatements and falsehoods.”).

23

Case 9:11-cr-80205-KAM Document 479 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2016 Page 24 of 26

produced 43 pages of her records. (DE298-1:66; DE241:30-31,35,98,100; DE277:4,5,9.) This is to be
compared with 200 million files relating to this investigation into Signalife. What is contained
within Tracy Jones' files? Do they contain additional back-up for the three purchase orders that she
also forgot about?
It can hardly be disputed that these circumstances may have “undermine[d] the fairness of
the criminal proceeding as a whole.” United States v. Davila, 133 S. Ct. 2139, 2149 (2013). In
addition to the foregoing admissions on appeal, the government now further admits that the CHM
purchase order was indeed a binding contract. (Ex. C at 59 (RB at 43).) In the words of the Supreme
Court, the government's case is unreliable and that unreliability has been brought about by what we
now know were intentional misrepresentations to this Court. Therefore, in this case, we have not
“simply an error in the trial process itself” but a defect that “def[ies] analysis by harmless-error
standards” in that it “affec[ted] the framework within which the trial proceeded” and created a
situation in which neither the Court nor Stein nor even the prosecutors had any chance of ever
learning the truth behind the government's allegations. Gonzales-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 148.
Again, whether the misstatements constitute reversible error is something the Eleventh
Circuit will soon rule on; however, the questions for review in this motion are the impact of the
Government’s admissions on the grand jury proceedings and whether the “search of truth” in the
criminal case against Stein can lawfully withstand what the government now admits were
inaccuracies in its case in combination with its prosecutors' intentional suppression of millions of
relevant files. Particularly considering the fact that the start-date for measuring loss for Stein's
sentence was that authentic CHM purchase order (DE428:211), Stein now submits that fundamental
fairness cannot withstand the result reached in this case.

V.

CONCLUSION
For all these reasons, Stein respectfully requests that the indictment be dismissed. In the

alternative, Stein seeks disclosure of grand jury materials as well as an order granting either a new
trial or an evidentiary hearing regarding the serious issues of misconduct presented by this case.
Lastly, Stein respectfully requests the Court issue a reasoned decision. 17
