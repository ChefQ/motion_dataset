thereafter as the matter may be heard, in Courtroom 13, of the above-entitled Court, located at
880 Front Street, No. 4290, San Diego, California 92101-8900, Defendants The Hertz
Corporation, Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc., Avis Budget Group Incorporated, Vanguard
Car Rental USA Inc., Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company, Fox Rent-A-Car Incorporated, and Coast
Leasing Corp. (collectively, the “
Rental Car Defendants”
) will and hereby do, move the Court for
an order to dismiss with prejudice the First and Second Causes of Action for failure to state a
claim.
This Motion is made on the basis that the allegations that Rental Car Defendants violated
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, fail to satisfy the pleading requirements articulated
by the Supreme Court in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007). Alternatively,
to the extent that Plaintiffs’Section 1 allegations are based on the Rental Car Defendants’
lobbying activities or their participation in a state-mandated industry referendum, the allegations
fail to state a claim because the challenged conduct is immune from antitrust liability under the
Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the challenged conduct is specifically authorized by state law, or,
alternatively, the Plaintiffs have not suffered antitrust injury and therefore lack standing. The
Rental Car Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs’purported claims under California’
s
Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq., and the False Advertising Law,
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 et seq., on the ground that their alleged conduct is immune from
liability pursuant to Section 13995.90 of the California Government Code. Alternatively,
Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the Unfair Competition Law and the False Advertising Law
because they do not and cannot show that the Rental Car Defendants’alleged conduct, which
Plaintiffs admit was permitted under the California Tourism Marketing Act, was unlawful, unfair
or fraudulent; Plaintiffs do not and cannot show that the conduct at issue violated the Sherman
Act or any other law.
