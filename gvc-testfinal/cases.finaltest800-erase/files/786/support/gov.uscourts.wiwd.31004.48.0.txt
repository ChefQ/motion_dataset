IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
ESSOCIATE, INC.,
Plaintiff,

CASE NO. 3:11-cv-00727-bbc

v.
AZOOGLE.COM, INC., and EPIC MEDIA
GROUP, INC.,
Defendants.
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ESSOCIATE, INC.’S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Essociate recently learned that defendant Epic Media Group, Inc.
(“Epic”) is apparently refusing to pay its debts and directing its clients to pay another
entity called “Kinetic Social” instead of Epic. Based on the facts set forth below,
Essociate reasonably believes that Epic’s former management formed Social Assets,
LLC, which does business as “Kinetic Social”, one month after this lawsuit was filed—
and transferred assets to Social Assets—for the purpose of avoiding Epic’s debts to
current creditors as well as Epic’s liability to potential creditors such as Essociate.
Consequently, Essociate respectfully requests the Court grant it leave to file a
First Amended Complaint in the above lawsuit. In its original complaint, Essociate
alleges that Azoogle.com, Inc. and Epic Media Group, Inc. have infringed and continue
to infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,804,660 entitled “System Method and Article of
Manufacture for Internet Based Affiliate Pooling” (the “ ‘660 Patent”).
Essociate now moves to add Social Assets, LLC as a defendant. On information
and belief, Social Assets is a successor entity to and/or alter ego of Epic and bears
1

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 2 of 10

liability for Epic’s infringement of the ‘660 Patent. Essociate seeks to add those claims
and claims for fraudulent transfer against Epic and Social Assets.
The proposed amendment will not cause undue delay or prejudice. Essociate
respectfully requests this Court grant it leave under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) to file the
proposed First Amended Complaint which is attached as Exhibit A to Essociate’s Motion
for Leave to Amend.
I.
A.

FACTS

Kinetic Social is the successor in interest to Epic and the transferee of Epic’s
assets outside the ordinary course of business.
According to its own press release, “Kinetic Social was founded in early 2010 by

a group of experienced internet advertising professionals to solve the challenges of
attribution and effective data-rich analytics in a social milieu.” (Declaration of Derek
Linke in Support of Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (“Linke Decl.”) ¶ 2,
Ex. A.) Kinetic Social’s website explains that Kinetic began “under the [Epic] umbrella”
in 2010. (Id. at ¶ 3, Ex. B.)
Kinetic Social did not become a separate entity from Epic until much later, after
this lawsuit was filed. Social Assets LLC was formed in Delaware in November 2011—
one month after this lawsuit was filed against Epic. (Linke Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C.) Social
Assets is the registrant of the domain name <<kineticsocial.com>> and the owner of a
trademark application for KINETIC SOCIAL. (Linke Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6, Exs. D and E.)
This lawsuit was filed in October 2011. (See Dkt. No. 1). The following month,
Social Assets was formed and began doing business as “Kinetic Social”, which was
previously an internal division of Epic. (See Linke Decl., Ex. A.)

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 3 of 10

Kinetic Social is now operated by Epic’s former management:
•

Don Mathis was Epic’s President and CEO. He is now Kinetic Social’s CEO. He
joined Kinetic Social in 2011. (Linke Decl. at ¶ 7, Ex. F.)

•

Rick Okin was Epic’s CIO and now fills the same role at Kinetic Social. He
joined Kinetic Social in October 2011. (Id., Ex. G.)

•

Stephen McDermott was Epic’s Senior Account Executive. He is now the
Director of Social Media at Kinetic Social. Interestingly, he remained at Epic until
November 2011 even though he joined Kinetic Social a month earlier. (Id., Ex.
H.)

•

Paul Biondi was the Manager of Creative Services at Epic and took over the same
role at Kinetic Social in October 2011. (Id., Ex. I.)

•

Charlie Nowaczek was Epic’s COO and is now the COO at Kinetic Social. (Id.,
Ex. J.)

•

Nate Armstrong was Epic’s Vice President of Sales and is now Kinetic Social’s
Director of Sales. (Id., Ex. K.)
On June 6, 2012—Essociate learned from the online publication Performance

Industry Insider that Epic is refusing to pay its debts and directing its clients to pay
Kinetic Social instead of Epic:
[A]lmost a year ago the executives knew that the company was eventually
going to go out of business. They were so certain the company was in
trouble that all the executives of the company left Epic Media Group, took
the profitable social media assets and turned it into another company
called Kinetic Social. Same CEO, same clients, same executive staff.
...according to former clients of Epic, Kinetic Social is now working for
them and billing them under the new name. Yes, you heard that – they are
billing former Epic clients, according to an insider I spoke with, and
telling them to pay Kinetic Social instead of Epic.
(Linke Decl. at ¶ 8, Ex. L.) A debt workout specialist recently issued a letter on Epic’s
behalf detailing Epic’s plans to confront its massive debts without filing for bankruptcy.
(Id. at ¶ 9, Ex. M.) Another recent Performance Industry Insider article reported that
Epic’s board of directors has been discussing filing for bankruptcy. (Id. at ¶ 10, Ex. N.)

3

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 4 of 10

The day after the June 6, 2012 Performance Industry Insider article was
published—on June 7, 2012—Epic’s counsel moved to withdraw from this case because
“the defendants have not paid any of the fees owed to Godfrey & Kahn in this matter.”
(Dkt. No. 33.) Godfrey & Kahn had represented Epic since the outset of this case, when it
filed Epic’s Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims. (Dkt. No. 6.)
Epic’s financial difficulties continued to mount. The week after the June 6, 2012
Performance Industry Insider article was published—on June 15, 2012—the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted a $ 3.5 million
judgment against Epic’s wholly-owned subsidiary Connexus Corporation, as well as the
related entities Firstlook, Inc., and Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc. (Linke Decl. ¶¶ 11–
12, Ex. O and Ex. P at ¶¶ 2-3.)
Based on these facts, Essociate infers that Epic’s management has long been
aware of Epic’s financial difficulties and that Epic has transferred and continues to
transfer its assets to Kinetic Social outside the ordinary course of business, for the
purpose of avoiding Epic’s debts to current creditors as well as Epic’s liability to
potential creditors such as Essociate.
B.

This case is still in its early stages.
Since this case was filed in October 2011, the parties have exchanged written

discovery requests and responses. (Linke Decl. at ¶ 13.) There have been no depositions.
(Id. at ¶ 13.)
Essociate did schedule a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Epic. (Linke Decl. at ¶ 14,
Ex. Q.) Essociate served the deposition notice on Epic’s counsel—including its current
counsel Godfrey & Kahn—on June 5, 2012, two days before Godfrey & Kahn moved to
withdraw because Epic had not paid it. (Id.) The deposition was scheduled for July 6,
4

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 5 of 10

2012. (Id.) Epic did not appear for the deposition—although Godfrey & Kahn reappeared as Epic’s counsel the day before the deposition, after a brief one-month
absence. (Linke Decl. at ¶ 15; Dkt. No. 40.) As indicated in an email from Essociate’s
counsel to Epic’s counsel:
We attempted to negotiate mutually-acceptable dates with Epic’s former
primary litigation counsel for over three months. Epic’s counsel was
unresponsive. Finally, on June 5, 2012, Essociate was forced to
unilaterally select dates and serve deposition notices, including the notice
of Rule 30(b)(6) deposition set for tomorrow.
That deposition notice was properly served on Epic’s counsel, including
your law firm. We never received any objection, formal or informal, to
that deposition notice before your firm and Epic’s other counsel moved to
withdraw. The correspondence Epic’s general counsel sent the Court
indicated that Epic’s representation issues would be resolved by June 29
(see Dkt. # 37) but by that date Epic was still not represented by counsel.
(Linke Decl. at ¶ 16, Ex. R.)
Epic and Essociate have tentatively planned depositions for the last week of
September and the first week of October. (Linke Decl. at ¶ 17.) The Court recently
granted a request by Epic, which Essociate agreed to, to extend all deadlines in this case
by about four months due to Epic’s “acute financial difficulties.” (See Dkt. Nos. 43 and
46).
II.

ARGUMENT

Leave to amend a complaint “shall be freely granted when justice so requires.”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). In determining whether a plaintiff satisfies this standard, courts
consider a number of factors, including whether there is “undue delay, bad faith or
dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of
allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment.” Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630

5

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 6 of 10

F.3d 546, 562, (7th Cir. 2010) (citing Airborne Beepers & Video, Inc. v. AT&T Mobility
LLC, 499 F.3d 663, 666 (7th Cir. 2007), quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83
S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)). In this case, Essociate has prosecuted the case with
diligence—so there is no undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on its part. Nor will
the amendment case undue prejudice or be futile.
A.

Essociate has been diligent.
One of the Bausch factors is whether there has been “undue delay [or] bad faith or

dilatory motive on the part of the movant.” Bausch, 630 F.3d at 562. In this case,
Essociate moved to amend its complaint shortly after it learned of Epic’s fraudulent asset
transfers to Social Assets—and shortly after Epic’s non-attendance at its scheduled Rule
30(b)(6) deposition prevented Essociate from asking questions about its relationship with
Social Assets. If there has been any undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive, it has been
caused by Epic, not Essociate.
B.

Neither Epic nor Kinetic Social will suffer undue prejudice.
Bausch also asks whether there will be “undue prejudice to the opposing party by

virtue of allowance of the amendment.” Bausch, 630 F.3d at 562. There will be no such
prejudice in this case. Social Assets was formed by several officers of Epic—accordingly,
Social Assets can reasonably be expected to have knowledge of this lawsuit and access to
all relevant materials. Also, Epic’s former and current counsel Godfrey & Kahn has been
involved in this case since the beginning, with only a one-month hiatus. Epic has not
conducted any depositions. And at Epic’s request, the Court recently extended all case
deadlines by several months. Any arguments of unfair prejudice or undue delay would
not be well-founded.

C.

The proposed amendment is not futile.
Further, the proposed amendment is not futile. Essociate proposes the addition of

causes of action for successor liability and alter ego liability against Kinetic Social and
claims for fraudulent transfer against Epic and Kinetic Social.
1.

Essociate’s proposed claim for imposition of successor liability against
Social Assets is not futile.

State law governs the doctrine of successor liability, and if established, subjects
the successor entity of an infringing entity to liability for patent infringement. See Funai
Elec. Co., Ltd. v. Daewoo Elecs. Corp., 616 F.3d 1357, 1380, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS
18237 (Fed. Cir. 2010).
Epic and Social Assets are both Delaware entities. If the issue of successor
liability is viewed as one of tort law, Delaware courts have ruled that the law of the place
of the tort applies. See Sellon v. General Motors Corp., D.Del., 521 F. Supp. 978, 981
(1981). Patent infringement is a tort. Medi-Tec of Egypt Corp. v. Bausch & Lomb
Surgical, 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 21, 16 n. 30, 2004 WL 5366102 (Del. Ch. Mar. 4, 2004).
And both Epic and Social Assets operate in New York. (Linke Decl. at ¶¶ 18,19, Exs. S,
T.) Accordingly, New York law applies to the question of successor liability.
Under New York law a corporation may be held liable for the torts of its
predecessor if:
(1) it expressly or impliedly assumed the predecessor’s tort liability, (2)
there was a consolidation or merger of seller and purchaser, (3) the
purchasing corporation was a mere continuation of the selling corporation,
or (4) the transaction is entered into fraudulently to escape such
obligations.
Schumacher v. Richards Shear Co., 59 N.Y.2d 239, 245, 451 N.E.2d 195, 464 N.Y.S.2d
437, 1983 N.Y. LEXIS 3122, (N.Y. 1983).

7

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 8 of 10

In this case, there is evidence indicating that Social Assets is merely continuing
Epic’s business. Both entities offer Internet marketing services, and both are run by the
same people. On information and belief, Epic transferred assets to Social Assets for less
than adequate consideration and in transactions that were not arm’s-length. While there
are questions of fact concerning the relationship between Epic and Social Direct, there is
evidence indicating Social Assets is continuing Epic’s business and that the two entities
have collaborated in fraudulent transfers of assets. Transferring assets from one company
to another to protect them from the first company’s creditors is a fraudulent conveyance.
Consequently, Essociate has a sound basis for claiming Social Assets is Epic’s successor
and naming Social Assets as an additional defendant.
2.

Essociate’s proposed claim for imposition of alter ego liability against
Social Assets is not futile.

Under Delaware law, separate legal entities are regarded as alter egos where:
there is fraud or where one company is “in fact a mere instrumentality” of the other.
Trustees of Arden v. Unity Constr. Co., 2000 Del. Ch. LEXIS 7, 12 (Del. Ch. Jan. 26,
2000). Epic and Social Assets are probably alter egos under either of those standards.
Epic’s former management created, and then fraudulently transferred Epic assets
to Social Assets after the filing of this lawsuit. Then most or all of Epic’s former
management left Epic and took on identical positions with Social Assets. Epic is now be
operating under the direction of Social Assets and Epic’s former management—Epic is
directing clients that owe it money to pay that money to Social Assets instead.
3.

Essociate’s proposed cause of action for fraudulent transfer is not
futile.

Under Delaware law, a claim for fraudulent transfer of assets exists under two
circumstances:
8

Case: 3:11-cv-00727-bbc Document #: 48 Filed: 08/06/12 Page 9 of 10

•

First, the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud any creditor of the debtor. 6 Del. C. § 1304(a)(1).

•

Second, the debtor made the transfer (1) “without receiving a reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for the transfer” and (2) either “was engaged or
was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining
assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or
transaction; or intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have
believed that the debtor would incur, debts beyond the debtor's ability to pay
as they became due.” Roseton OL, LLC v. Dynegy Holdings, Inc., 2011 Del.
Ch. LEXIS 113, 62, 2011 WL 3275965 (Del. Ch. July 29, 2011) (citing 6 Del.
C. § 1304(a)(2)).

Both of these circumstances apply here. After Essociate filed this lawsuit, and
after Epic incurred significant debt to other creditors, all or nearly all of Epic’s former
executive management formed a new, separate company, and transferred one of Epic’s
existing lines of business to that company. Now Epic is telling its creditors that it does
not have sufficient funds to pay them most of the amount owed, and directing clients that
owe it money to pay Social Assets instead.
And Essociate’s claim against Social Assets as the fraudulent transferee is not
futile because: “a defrauded creditor may seek recovery not only from the transferor but
from a transferee as well.” Mitsubishi Power Sys. Ams., Inc. v. Babcock & Brown
Infrastructure Group US, LLC, 2009 Del. Ch. LEXIS 59, 16 (Del. Ch. Apr. 24, 2009).

III.

CONCLUSION

Epic is engaging in gamesmanship with its creditors via Social Assets LLC dba
Kinetic Social. Social Assets is Epic’s successor and alter ego and shares Epic’s liability
for patent infringement. And Epic appears to have fraudulently transferred to Social
Assets an entire line of business in order to frustrate Essociate and other creditors.
Essociate respectfully requests that the Court grant it leave to file a First Amended
Complaint as attached hereto.
