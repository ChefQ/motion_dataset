Plaintiffs Celeste Spicer, Autumn Burgess, Amy Ledin, Joseph Russo, Esther Martinez,
Lysette Roman, and Serena Siying Hui, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated
(collectively, "Plaintiffs'"), submit this memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants Pier
Sixty, LLC and James Kirsch's (collectively, ""Defendants'') motion for partial reconsideration of
this Court's July 26, 2010 Order ("Order").'

I. INTRODUCTION

In its Order, this Court, applying the standard set forth in Samiento v. World Yacht Inc.,
10 N.Y.3d 70 (2008), found, inter alia, that the reasonable customer could have believed that
Defendants' service charge for events using Form Contract 3 was a gratuity. Therefore, the
Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to events using Form
Contract 3. In so doing, the Court cited factors listed in the New York Department of Labor's
("NYDOL") March 11, 2010 opinion letter (`March 11, 2010 Letter" or "Letter'"), and noted that
some of these factors could have led a reasonable customer to believe that Defendants' service
charge under Form Contract 3 was a gratuity that should have been distributed in full to
Defendants' service staff.

Defendants now ask the Court to reconsider its Order with respect to Form Contract 3.
However, Defendants are not entitled to reconsideration simply because they are dissatisfied.
Reconsideration is warranted only under very limited circumstances, such as where a court has
overlooked controlling law or facts or to prevent manifest injustice. None of these circumstances
are present here. In seeking reconsideration, Defendants attempt to "plug the gaps" of their
previous arguments and set forth a brand new argument in support of their position. Specifically,

Defendants ask the Court to abandon its modest position that the factors set forth in the March

 

* Tn support of this memorandum of law, Plaintiffs submit the September 21, 2010 Declaration of Denise A.
Schulman ("Schulman Decl.'') and exhibits thereto.
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 _ Filed 09/21/10 Page 4 of 12

11, 2010 Letter may be relevant to assessing the reasonable customer's beliefs regarding
Defendants' service charge under Form Contract 3. In doing so, Defendants advance the
extreme and legally unsupportable view that the Court is prohibited from agreeing with the
NYDOL. Not only is this argument absurd on its face, but it cannot support reconsideration
because Defendants failed to raise it in connection with the underlying summary judgment
motion. In addition, there is no manifest injustice in the Court's position that the totality of the
circumstances should be considered in applying the reasonable customer standard. On the
contrary, a totality of the circumstances analysis is traditionally applied to "reasonable person"
tests in a variety of contexts, and it is appropriate here. Finally, Defendants' arguments
regarding their e-mail communications with customers and their no tipping policy have already
been considered and rejected by the Court and should not be revisited.

For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion should be denied.

I. ARGUMENT

Reconsideration "is an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the interests of
finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.'" Parrish v. Sollecito, 253 F. Supp. 2d
713, 715 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). Motions for reconsideration "`must be narrowly construed and
strictly applied in order to discourage litigants from making repetitive arguments on issues that

399

have been thoroughly considered by the court.'" Regent Ins. Co. v. Store King Constructing,
Inc., No. 06 Civ. 2879, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37189, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2008) (Sand, J.).
"The major grounds justifying reconsideration are `an intervening change of controlling law, the

availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.'"

Virgin Atlantic Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992).
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 Filed 09/21/10 Page 5 of 12

A party making a motion for reconsideration may not "make new arguments that could
have been previously advanced." Scott v. City of New York, No. 02 Civ. 9530, 2009 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 88169, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2009); see also, e.g., Spain v. Deutsche Bank, No. 08
Civ. 10809, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113519, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2009) (Sand, J.) (same);
Ballard v. Parkstone Energy, LLC, No. 06 Civ. 13099, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71350, at *3
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2008) (same); Regent Ins. Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37189, at *4 (same).
Rather, "a motion for reconsideration is appropriate only where the movant demonstrates that
`the Court has overlooked controlling decisions or factual matters that were put before it on the
underlying motion . . . and which, had they been considered, might have reasonably altered the
result before the court.'" Range Rd. Music, Inc. v. Music Sales Corp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 390, 392
(S.D.N.Y. 2000) (emphasis and omission in original).

Defendants argue that controlling law precludes the Court from relying on the March 11,
2010 Letter and that reliance on the Letter would be unjust because it was improperly obtained
and not issued until after they moved for summary judgment. (Defs.' Recons. Mem. at 6-11.)
These arguments fail because (1) they are barred from asserting the argument that the Court
overlooked controlling law because they did not raise this argument in connection with their
summary judgment motion; (2) in any event, the Court did not overlook any controlling law; and
(3) the origin and timing of the March 11, 2010 Letter are irrelevant.

A. Defendants Are Barred From Asserting That The Court Overlooked

Controlling Law Because They Did Not Raise This Argument In Any Of
The Papers Submitted In Support Of Their Motion For Summary

Judgment

Defendants are barred from now arguing that controlling law precludes the Court from
deferring to the March 11, 2010 Letter because they failed to advance this argument in

connection with their summary judgment motion. Spain, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113519, at *3
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 _ Filed 09/21/10 Page 6 of 12

("We note at the outset that Plaintiffs did not cite Radiation Dynamics in their underlying brief
and raise this argument for the first time in the instant motion. For this reason alone,
reconsideration is not appropriate."); see also Carolco Pictures Inc. v. Sista, 700 F. Supp. 169,
172 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (denying motion for reargument where movant's "motion for reargument
raises a new matter that was not `overlooked' by the court because it was never presented to the
court in the first place"). Defendants had ample opportunity to raise this argument in their reply
papers, at oral argument, or in their post-oral argument letter to the Court.' At those times,
however, Defendants argued only that the March 11, 2010 Letter did not apply to them because
they did not make any representations to their customers that contradicted the terms of Form
Contract 3. (Defs.' Summ. J. R. Mem. at 11.) Now that the Court has rejected this argument,
Defendants may not seek to "plug[] the gaps of [their] lost motion with additional matters" such
as allegedly "controlling" judicial decisions that pre-dated Defendants' motion. Parrish, 253 F.
Supp. 2d at 715 (internal quotation marks omitted).

B. Defendants Have Not Identified Any Controlling Authority That The
Court Overlooked

Defendants have not identified any controlling authority that the Court overlooked in
denying their motion for summary judgment with respect to Form Contract 3. In its Order, the
Court found that a host of factors, many but not all of which were listed in the March 11, 2010
Letter, could be relevant to determining whether the reasonable customer would have believed
that Defendants' service charge was a gratuity. Order at 10-13. Because a rational jury could

determine that these factors would lead the reasonable customer to believe that the service charge

 

* Defendants note that the March 11, 2010 letter was issued after they filed their motion for summary judgment, and
therefore they could not address the letter in their moving papers. (Defs.' Recons. Mem. at 10 n.8.) This is
irrelevant. Plaintiffs cited the March 11, 2010 letter in their opposition to Defendants' motion for summary
judgment. Defendants could have but did not advance their current argument in their reply papers, which they filed
on May 17, 2010.
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 _ Filed 09/21/10 Page 7 of 12

was a gratuity, the Court denied summary judgment. /d. at 13. The Court was clear that it was
not strictly bound by the March 11, 2010 Letter, but rather followed it because "it is both
reasonable and derived from an understanding of the `underlying operational practices' of the
New York banquet industry.' Jd. at 11. Indeed, the Court also noted that "we are mindful that
the March 11, 2010 NYDOL Letter suggests measures that may be prophylactic in nature and not
strictly required by the reasonable customer standard in every instance[.|" Id. at 12 (emphasis
added). Given the Court's recognition that it was not required to follow the March 11, 2010
Letter as a matter of law, Defendants in effect take the untenable position that "controlling"
authority requires the Court to disagree with the NYDOL and prohibits the Court from agreeing
with the NYDOL.

The federal decisions Defendants cite are not controlling law because (1) none of the
decisions address the relevant question of New York state law, namely, the proper deference for
a court to give a New York agency's interpretation of New York law, see Yang v. ACBL Corp.
427, F. Supp. 2d 327 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Sand, J.) (applying New York law and declining to defer
to NYDOL opinion letter interpreting a New York regulation); and (2) even if the decisions
addressed the appropriate issue, all but one of them are not binding on this Court and therefore
cannot be "controlling." See Ivan Visin Shipping, Ltd. v. Onego Shipping & Chartering B.V.,
543 F. Supp. 2d 338, 339 (2008) (stating that controlling decisions are those of the Second

Circuit or United States Supreme Court); U.S. Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Landau, No. 05 Civ.

 

> Defendants contend that the March 11, 2010 Letter was not based on an understanding of the banquet industry's
"underlying operational practices" because the NYDOL suggested that event facilities tell customers that they
should leave an additional gratuity for service staff. (Defs.' Recons. Mem. at 8 n.7.) This argument is puzzling
considering that the New York State Restaurant Association, a membership organization for restaurant owners and
service providers, included a similar recommendation in their draft guidelines for World Yacht compliance which
were created prior to March 11, 2010. (Schulman Decl. Ex. 1 at 3.) Clearly, at least some members of the banquet
industry believe, independent of the NYDOL's position, that it would be appropriate under industry standards for
customers to have the option to add an additional gratuity. The fact that Defendants do not wish to do this is
understandable given their representations to customers that the service charge is a gratuity.
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 _ Filed 09/21/10 Page 8 of 12

2049, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57462, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2010) (finding New York Court
of Appeals decision controlling law on question of state law). (See also Defs.' Recons. Mem. at
6-7 (citing New York v. Shalala, 119 F.3d 175 (2d Cir. 1997) (evaluating the proper deference to
give a federal agency's interpretation of a federal judicial decision); Akins v. Fed. Election
Comm'n, 101 F.3d 731 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (same); Yesil v. Reno, 973 F. Supp. 372 (S.D.N.Y.
1997) (same); Mojica v. Navas, 970 F. Supp. 130 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (same).)

The only case applying New York law that Defendants cite, Toys "R" Us v. Silva, 89
N.Y.2d 411 (1996), is also inapposite because it involves the question of proper deference to
give a state agency's interpretation of a statute, not of a judicial opinion like World Yacht. In
addition, the March 11, 2010 Letter does not constitute pure legal analysis. Rather, it addresses
the factual question of when a reasonable customer would believe that a charge is a gratuity.

The position taken by the Court in its Order and the NYDOL in the March 11, 2010
Letter that the totality of the circumstances should be considered in determining whether a
reasonable customer would believe a charge is a gratuity is consistent with the approach to
applying a reasonable person standard in a wide range of cases. E.g., Pa. State Police v. Suders,
542 U.S. 129 (2004) (considering totality of the circumstance in constructive discharge case);
Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991) (considering totality of the circumstances in determining
whether a Fourth Amendment seizure occurred); Mormol v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 364 F.3d
54 (2d Cir. 2004) (considering totality of the circumstances in determining whether there was an
objectively hostile work environment); United States v. Badmus, 325 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2003)
(considering totality of the circumstances in determining whether a suspect was in state custody);
Hartman y. County of Nassau, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34729 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2008)

(considering totality of the circumstances in determining whether there was probable cause). See
Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 Filed 09/21/10 Page 9 of 12

also Order at 11 ("{I]t is neither irrational nor unreasonable to maintain that a reasonable
customer's beliefs regarding the nature of a mandatory service fee would be influenced by the
totality of the banquet company's representations and the surrounding circumstances.").
Defendants have not proposed any alternative standard for assessing the belief of the

reasonable customer. Instead, Defendants ask this Court to reject well-established principles
regarding a reasonable person standard simply because that standard was advocated by the
NYDOL. However, the March 11, 2010 Letter is not inconsistent with N.Y. Lab. Law 0x00A7 196-d,
World Yacht, or any other authority interpreting World Yacht. Moreover, given how the
reasonable person standard has traditionally been applied, the Court would likely have adopted
the same approach it took in the Order even if the March 11, 2010 Letter did not exist.
Therefore, Defendants' motion should be denied.

C, The Origin And Timing Of The March 11, 2010 Letter Are Irrelevant

Defendants' next argument is that the Court should reconsider its Order because the

March 11, 2010 Letter was improperly obtained. (Defs.' Recons. Mem. at 8.) This argument is
wrong for several reasons. First, even if the Letter were improperly obtained, that would not bar
the Court from agreeing with the substance of the Letter. (See supra Section II.B.) Second, the
NYDOL has expressly stated that it "has no objection" to the use of the March 11, 2010 Letter in
connection with the Reilly v. Richmond County Country Club litigation, noting that it
"recognize[d] the authority of the Court to determining the relevance, materiality, and weight the
letter should be accorded[.]" Sept. 13,2010 NYDOL Letter.* Clearly, the NYDOL stands
behind the position it took in the March 11, 2010 Letter. Third, Defendants cite no authority
saying that the March 11, 2010 Letter is void on its face and should not apply here. Defendants

certainly cannot glean this from the Second Department's two sentence-long opinion in Reilly v.

 

* The Sept. 13, 2010 NYDOL Letter is attached hereto as Schulman Decl. Ex. 2.

Case 1:08-cv-10240-LBS Document 79 Filed 09/21/10 Page 10 of 12

Richmond County Country Club. (Richmond Decl. in Supp. of Recons. Ex. A.) Finally, the
March 11, 2010 Letter merely restated and elaborated on the standard previously set forth by the
NYDOL in a February 27, 2009 opinion letter. Feb. 27, 2009 NYDOL Letter? The NYDOL
issued the February 27, 2009 letter in response to letters from the New York State Restaurant
Association (""NYSRA") seeking the NYDOL's approval of certain guidelines it wished to give
its members regarding World Yacht compliance. Jd. Defendants likely had knowledge of the
February 27, 2009 letter before filing their motion for summary judgment, as Defendants'
counsel are labor counsel to the Greater New York City Chapters of the NYSRA. June 3, 2009
Letter from Carolyn D. Richmond to Jean Lindholm, NYDOL, at 1.0x00B0 Accordingly, Defendants'
contention that it would be manifestly unjust to rely on the March 11, 2010 Letter because it was
not issued until after they moved for summary judgment is ludicrous. There is no injustice in
applying the reasonable standard set forth in the March 11, 2010 Letter to Defendants' actions.'

D. The Court Has Already Considered And Rejected Defendants'
Arguments Regarding Their E-Mail Communications With Customers

The Court has already considered and rejected Defendants' argument that e-mail
communications between Defendants and their customers could not contribute to a reasonable
customer's belief that Defendants' service charge was a gratuity. Order at 13. Accordingly, this
argument cannot be a ground for reconsideration. Regent Ins. Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

37189, at *4 ("A motion for reconsideration is .. . [not] an argument for repeating old arguments

 

> The Feb. 27, 2009 NYDOL Letter is attached hereto as Schulman Decl. Ex. 1.

0x00B0 The June 3, 2009 Letter from Carolyn D. Richmond is attached hereto as Schulman Decl. Ex. 3 and was previously
submitted to this Court by Defendants as Exhibit L to the Declaration of Douglas L. Flaum in support of
Defendants' motion to certify the July 26, 2010 Order for interlocutory appeal.

' Defendants' implicit position that contractual language stating that a service charge is not a gratuity is sufficient to
comply with World Yacht, regardless of any other circumstances, would lead to unjust results. For example, under
that standard employers would be free to include such a disclaimer and keep all moneys collected as a service charge
even if they explicitly tell customers that the service charge is, nonetheless, a gratuity. Similarly, employers could
meet their obligations under World Yacht by including a disclaimer on their contracts in a font size too small for
most people to read. This cannot be what the World Yacht court intended when it set forth the reasonable patron
standard.
