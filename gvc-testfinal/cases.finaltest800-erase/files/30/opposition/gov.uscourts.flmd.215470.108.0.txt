KLEIN & HEUCHAN, INC'S MOTION IN LIMINE

Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs CoStar Group, Inc. and CoStar Realty Information, Inc.
(collectively, "CoStar') respectfully submit this Opposition to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Klein

& Heuchan, Inc.'s ("K&H") Motion in Limine.
INTRODUCTION

K&H instituted this action for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement, yet it actually
seeks to avoid any adjudication on the merits. Fully aware of the nature and scope of CoStar's
copyright infringement claims, K&H voluntarily chose not to conduct meaningful discovery.
Now, with trial looming on the March 2010 calendar, K&H repeats the same faulty request it
made when CoStar filed its Motion for Summary Judgment; namely, asking this Court to
preclude CoStar from putting forward evidence fundamental to its case. As with K&H's prior
Motion to Strike, which the Court denied, K&H now asks the Court to bar CoStar from

_ introducing documents it claims were produced only after the close of discovery and from

relying upon the testimony of a witness named Robert Lardizabal.

Unfortunately, K&H's Motion in Limine omits much of the picture. Most importantly,
K&H fails to mention that the Court already denied an essentially identical motion to strike in
this case, and the law of the case now precludes K&H from bringing that same motion again.
Moreover, K&H does not cite a single case to support the drastic exclusion remedy that it
requests. K&H fails to accurately describe the evidence it seeks to bar from trial, which in vast
measure includes documents produced or within the knowledge of the parties prior to the close
of discovery. K&H omits any discussion of its own repeated failures and refusals to take
discovery. Finally, K&H further overlooks that the parties have already stipulated to the very
facts that would otherwise be proven by the evidence it seeks to exclude, thereby mooting much
of its present motion. . Accordingly, consistent with its earlier ruling on these very same issues,

the Court should deny K&H's Motion in Limine in its entirety.
ARGUMENT

K&H's motion neither cites a single case supporting its position nor does it present the

Court with the real legal standard for the extraordinary relief that it seeks.

Rule 37(c) states that exclusion of witnesses and other evidence is inappropriate where
the failed disclosure was "substantially justified" or "harmless." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). Courts
have further clarified that preclusion under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 37(c) should only occur
in "rare cases." See, e.g., Semi-Tech Litig. LLC v. Bankers Trust Co., 219 F.R.D. 324, 325
(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (rejecting preclusion where failure to prepare case in timely manner was due to
inattention rather than bad faith and in absence of showing of a substantial prejudice to opposing
party ). It is a "severe sanction" that should only be granted where the alleged failure to disclose

cannot be cured by allowing the party receiving the late disclosure an opportunity to conduct

 
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 _ Filed 02/17/10 Page 3 of 16

discovery on that disclosure. Lithuanian Commerce Corp. v. Sara Lee Hosiery, 177 F.R.D. 245,
254 (D.N.J. 1997). Indeed, the great weight of case law indicates that exclusion is inappropriate

when the Court has the ability to remedy the lack of disclosure before trial.!

In the Eleventh Circuit, a court ruling on an exclusion request is required to consider (1)
the importance of the testimony; (2) the reason for the failure to disclose the witness earlier; and
(3) the prejudice to the opposing party if the witness had been allowed to testify. See, e.g.,
Rogers v. Muscogee County School District, 165 F.3d 812, 818 (1 1" Cir. 1999). Stated
differently, a court determining whether a failure to disclose evidence is substantially justified or
harmless considers (1) surprise to the party against whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the |
ability of that party to cure the surprise; (3) the degree to which allowing he evidence would
disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the evidence; and (5) the explanation for the failure to
disclose the evidence. United States v. Breathe Easy Pulmonary Svcs., No. 8:06-cv-40-T-

33MAP, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, 4567, *8 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 14, 2009). .

As discussed below, K&H's Motion in Limine cannot withstand scrutiny under these

standards and should be denied in its entirety.

 

' See, e.g. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Intercounty Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 412 F.3d 745, 752 (70x2122 Cir. 2005) (holding that
the sanction of exclusion was too severe when continuance could be granted to allow for discovery of previously
undisclosed expert notes); Jackson v. Fed. Express Corp., No. 3:03-CV-2341-D, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39281, *5-
*6 (N.D. Tex. June 14, 2006) (allowing additional depositions and rejecting motion to exclude where party failed to
meet its obligations under Rule 26 and in responding to interrogatories); Semi-T: ech Litig. LLC v. Bankers Trust
Col., 219 F.R.D. at 325 (holding that preclusion is appropriate only in "rare cases" and providing opportunity for
deposition testimony in lieu of preclusion); and Equant Integrations Servs. v. United Rentals (N. Am.), Inc., No. 3:01
CV 1134 (JBA), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26657, *19-*22 (D. Conn. Apr. 17, 2002) (preclusion not appropriate if
lack of disclosure is harmless or can be remedied through additional discovery).

THE COURT PREVIOUSLY RULED ON K&H'S MOTION.

Except in one brief footnote, K&H fails to disclose to the Court that it has already
rejected an attempt by K&H to strike many of the same documents and testimony. Specifically,
on November 6, 2009, this Court denied a motion to strike that K&H filed seeking to bar CoStar
from relying on Robert Lardizabal's testimony and certain documents at summary judgment.
(See Order dated Nov. 6. 2009 (DE # 83)). Accordingly, not only has the Court already ruled on
the propriety of the admission of that evidence, but Klein & Heuchan has now had been aware of

that evidence for more than five months.

None of the arguments put forward in K&H's current Motion in Limine differ from the
arguments it previously put forward in its Motion to Strike; namely, that the documents should
have been produced during discovery and that Mr. Lardizabal should have been identified by
CoStar in its initial disclosures and responses to interrogatories. (See DE # 75.) CoStar opposed
the Motion to Strike, explaining, among other things, that (4) Mr. Lardizabal is an employee in
CoStar's Product Development department whose limited testimony merely sponsors and
explains exhibits as CoStar business records kept in the ordinary course of CoStar's operations
(data recorded by CoStar during use of its products), and (11) the documents challenged by K&H
included copies of a representative pool of infringed photographs and the associated copyright
registrations. (See DE # 82.) This Court ultimately denied K&H's motion to strike the very

same documents and witness it now seeks exclude. (See Order dated Nov. 6. 2009 (DE # 83)).

This Court should again reject K&H's attempt to litigate this case on misplaced
procedural attacks. As discussed below, K&H's argument is no better a second time. Moreover,

the "law of the case" makes it improper for K&H to attempt to re-litigate the issue. See,,
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 | Filed 02/17/10 Page 5 of 16

e.g., Validsa, Inc. v. PDVSA Servs., No. 08-21682, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7545 (S.D. Fla. Jan.

29, 2010) (citing Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 235 F.3d 1307, 1313 (11th Cir. 2000), for

 

proposition that, under the law-of-the-case doctrine, the resolution of an issue decided at one

stage of a case is binding at later stages of the same case)).

Il. A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE DOCUMENTS MOOTS K&H's MOTION.

K&H's Motion in Limine blindly seeks to exclude nearly 1600 pages of documents that it

claims were "dumped upon counsel for K&H" after expiration of the discovery deadline. (See

 

K&H's Motion in Limine, dated Feb. 8, 2010, at paragraphs 14, 17-18.) The implication that the
documents are new to K&H and that it was surprised by them is without basis. As set forth

below, the documents that K&H complains of were not new to K&H:

(a) 366 pages were originally produced by Counter-Defendant C. Scott Bell ("Bell") prior to
the close of discovery. In fact, most of these documents were exhibits to Bell's
deposition, which took place prior to the close of discovery, with counsel for K&H
present. (See DE #74). CoStar merely affixed bates numbers to these documents for
ease of reference at trial and produced the bates-numbered versions to K&H. These 366
pages are COSTAR 366 - 620, COSTAR 639 - 660, and COSTAR 729 - 820.

(Declaration of Matthew Oppenheim , 2.a ("Oppenheim Decl.")).

(b) 855 pages are copies of the 41 infringed photographs and copyright

registrations/applications for the infringed CoStar photographs and market reports. These

 

? What concerns K&H is the probative value of the documents. This internal K&H email correspondence produced
by Bell --- but not by K&H --- reaches issues such as knowledge, inducement and financial benefit of and from the
infringing activity.

5
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 Filed 02/17/10 Page 6 of 16 (c)

 

855 pages are COSTAR 927 - 1100 and COSTAR 1309 - 1991. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.b).

For at least three reasons, K&H has no basis to complain about these documents:

o First, K&H had actual notice as to the existence of these documents, from
CoStar's Counterclaims, Rule 26 Disclosures, and Summary Judgment Motion,
see infra at 8-11, but yet never sought them in discovery or otherwise asked for
copies. Even though CoStar had no obligation to produce these documents until .
its pretrial disclosures, CoStar voluntarily produced them to K&H on December
7, 2009 and offered that K&H the opportunity to take further discovery regarding

these documents should it want to. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.b.1).

o Second, K&H already stipulated that CoStar owns and registered the 41 CoStar
photographs and 4 CoStar market reports that Bell downloaded to his computer
without authorization. (See Pretrial Disclosures, Exhibit C, {{ 1-3, 7 (DE # 96))
That stipulation moots K&H's motion in limine as to these documents. K&H
concedes the factual/legal issues as to which CoStar would offer these documents;

namely, to prove ownership, registration, and copying.

o Finally, even absent K&H's stipulations, these photographs and registrations are
merely additional examples of the exact same type of infringements already
produced on a representative basis to support CoStar's summary judgment
motion. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.b.ii). At that time, the Court rejected K&H's
motion to strike those documents and CoStar expressly noted it would produce
more of the same at any trial in this matter. (See CoStar's Summary Judgment

Motion, at 13 fn. 2 (DE # 69)) (Noting that the evidence for purposes of this
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 Filed 02/17/10 Page 7 of 16

motion was "exemplary in nature rather than comprehensive" because "the
predicate acts leading to infringement liability are the same" and that at any trial
CoStar would come forward with evidence of additional works infringed)). K&H
did not object to this at all or ask for production of the documents. (Oppenheim

Decl. 2.b.ii).

(c) 176 pages are the Declarations of Steve Williams and Robert Lardizabal submitted in
support of CoStar's summary judgment motion in September/October 2009, along with
`the corresponding exhibits and copyright registrations/applications. These 176 pages are
COSTAR 621- 638, COSTAR 661 - 727, and COSTAR 821-914. (Oppenheim Decl.
2.c). Again, CoStar merely affixed bates numbers to these documents for ease of
reference at trial. K&H never sought these documents in discovery, but received them
just shortly following the close of discovery in any event. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.c). The
Court's rejection of K&H's earlier motion to strike governs, and K&H's request for

preclusion of these documents is misplaced.

(d) 62 pages are simply a better, more complete version of a previously produced CoStar
spreadsheet containing CoStar business records regarding Bell's unauthorized usage of
the CoStar products. These 62 pages are COSTAR 1101 - 1163. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.d).
CoStar produced the updated version for ease of presentation at trial, if and to the extent
it is even necessary to do so. K&H has no reason to object to the this document,
especially when it already stipulated that Bell downloaded to his computer without
authorization the 41 CoStar photographs on the List of CoStar Photographs Allegedly
Infringed and the 4 CoStar market reports on the List of CoStar Market Reports

Allegedly Infringed. (See Pretrial Disclosures, Exhibit C, at {0x00A7 1-3, 7 (DE # 96))

7
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 Filed 02/17/10 Page 8 of 16

(e) 42 pages are background documents concerning CoStar and its products. These 42 pages
are COSTAR 1164 - 1206. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.e). They are from the publicly available
portion of the CoStar website at www.costar.com, equally available to anyone with an
Internet-connection. [d. K&H never sought these documents during discovery and their
production is not untimely. The documents will be helpful background for the Court at
trial, and will streamline trial testimony. Jd. K&H's attempt to preclude these documents

is unjustified.

(f) 101 pages are merely cleaner, color copies of documents produced by Bell prior to the
close of discovery. These 101 pages are COSTAR 1207 - 1308. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.f)
CoStar produced these for ease of reference and the Court's convenience at trial. It is
unclear why K&H would want to object to these documents. However, it lacks any basis
to do so. See, e.g., Laffy v. Janssen Phramaceutica, No. 3:03-cv-1005-J-12MCR, U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 14833, *2 (Mar. 31, 2006) (denying motion in Jimine with regard to

document that are simply better copies of documents disclosed during discovery).

(g) 12 pages are merely bates-numbered versions of the online Terms of Use agreement
posted and publicly available at www.costar.com. These 12 pages are COSTAR 915-
926. (Oppenheim Decl. 2.2) CoStar produced this document in the litigation long before
the discovery deadline. Id.; (see also Exhibit G to CoStar's Motion to Dismiss and/or

Transfer, Dated July 17, 2008.) K&H has no basis to seek preclusion of this document.

In sum, the foregoing examination of the roughly 1600 documents at issue shows that K&H's

suggestion of surprise and prejudice lacks merit.

II. K&H'S ATTEMPTS TO TURN ITS OWN FAILURE TO CONDUCT
DISCOVERY INTO A SWORD TO FORESTALL A TRIAL ON THE MERITS.

K&H's motion attempts to cover-up its own failure to conduct discovery. The sum total
of K&H's discovery efforts was to serve perfunctory and broadly-worded interrogatories and
document requests. (See K&H's Motion in Limine, at Exhs B and D (DE #101)). It opted
against requesting any discovery even remotely tailored to the key allegations of CoStar's
claims. It also opted against taking a single deposition, including any Rule 30(b)(6) deposition
of CoStar, or a deposition of the individual identified in CoStar's initial disclosures as a CoStar

witness with relevant knowledge.

In its Rule'26 disclosures and its Counterclaims, CoStar identified copyright registrations
and infringed photographs as documents it would rely upon. K&H's document requests and
interrogatories did not contain a single request for identification or production of the

photographs or copyright registrations that CoStar believed K&H infringed, even though:

(a) CoStar's Counterclaims specifically indicated that Bell and K&H infringed "more

than 100" copyrighted CoStar photographs as a result of Bell's unauthorized use;

(b) CoStar's Counterclaims specifically provided "a partial list of these photographs, as

well as the copyright registrations corresponding thereto;" and

(c) CoStar's initial disclosures specifically identified copyright registrations and
information concerning K&H's access to CoStar's products as separate categories of

documents that it would rely upon.

(See CoStar's Answer & Counterclaim (DE # 23), at 0x00A7 30; and K&H's Motion in Limine (DE #

101), at Exh. A.)
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 108 Filed 02/17/10 Page 10 of 16

K&H had actual notice about the nature and scope of CoStar's infringement allegations,
including as to some of the specific building photographs and copyright registrations. However,
K&H voluntarily chose never to ask CoStar to identify or produce copies of the photo graphs and
associated copyright registrations that CoStar alleged Bell and K&H infringed. K&H chose not
to follow-up with questions about CoStar's discovery responses, initial disclosures, or

Counterclaims..

Preclusion in this situation is not only unwarranted, but it would reward K&H for its own
discovery failings. See Tolerico v. Home Depot, 205 F.R.D. 169, 176 (M.D. Pa. 2002)
(exclusion is inappropriate where moving party is sufficiently aware that material has not been
produced); Two Men And A Truck Int'l v. Residential and Comm'l Transport Co. LLC, No.4:08-
CV-67-WS/WCS, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103896, *6 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 20, 2008) (exclusion
inappropriate where moving party had knowledge of lack of disclosures and failed to voice an

objection, ask for the documents or move to compel).

Even after the formal close of discovery, K&H had multiple opportunities to take
`discovery on what it now seeks to exclude but opted against it in each instance. First, in its
opposition to K&H's Motion to Strike, CoStar consented to K&H conducting limited additional
discovery. (See CoStar's Opposition to K&H's Motion to Strike (DE # 82), dated October 30,
2009, at 3, 11-12) In response, K&H did nothing. Second, in early November 2009, CoStar
retained undersigned counsel and the parties filed a stipulated request to extend the deadlines for
the pretrial conference and the trial. (DE # 86) In that Motion, K&H indicated it was

"considering filing a motion in limine to exclude certain evidence or in the alternative to permit
