Civil No. 1:08-CV-00212-MP-AK

OPPOSITION BY UNITED STATES TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED PLEADING
The United States of America, through undersigned counsel, files its Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Amended Pleading. The Court should deny
Plaintiff’s motion, because it is untimely, futile, and the underlying facts and
circumstances relied upon by Plaintiff are not a proper subject of relief. Plaintiff wishes
only to re-argue Plaintiff’s claim that the salary he received in exchange for his services
as a driver for United Parcel Service during the years 2003 through 2007, was not
“wages” subject to the federal income tax.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff is a tax defier who believes that he – unique among the other over onehundred million taxpayers in the United States – is exempt from application of the
Internal Revenue Code to his wages and other income. Plaintiff initiated this suit on
October 3, 2008, by filing a complaint (dkt 1) alleging that the income tax is
unconstitutional as applied to his wages, that the tax assessments against him are illegal,
and that the lien filings and other collection activities undertaken by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to his tax liabilities for the years 2003 through 2007 were not only

improper, but entitle him to recover damages under the Internal Revenue Code he
purports to disavow. After the United States filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s original
complaint (dkt 8), on March 24, 2009, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (dkt 19),
dropping his claim for damages for failure to release liens, but maintaining that he is
entitled to a refund of taxes paid for the years 2003 through 2007, on the grounds, first,
that Plaintiff owes no taxes on account of his compensation for services rendered during
all the years at issue because, according to Plaintiff, that compensation was not “wages”;
and, second, that the Sixteenth Amendment does not authorize a non-apportioned direct
income tax on United States citizens.
On March 25, 2009, the United States filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment (dkt 19), presenting both
jurisdictional and substantive arguments. On July 10, 2009, Plaintiff filed his own
motion for summary judgment (dkt 24), pressing the legal argument that the salary he
received from UPS was not subject to the federal income tax.
On June 30, 2009, the Court entered an Order (dkt 23) adopting the deadlines
proposed by the parties’ in their Rule 26(f) report, which set a deadline of August 17,
2009, for the filing of all motions to amend pleadings.
More than four months after that deadline expired, on December 23, 2009,
Plaintiff filed this Motion for Leave to File Amended Pleading (dkt 41) (“Motion”).
Plaintiff does not detail what prompted him to belatedly seek leave to amend his
complaint. He states only that “plaintiff has learned through review of the pleadings that
it is appropriate and necessary for plaintiff to correct the allegations in his complaint to
frame the issues more succinctly in conformity with the case law upon which plaintiff

relies, and to delete superfluous statements and issues.” Motion, at 2 (¶ 7). More likely,
Plaintiff now seeks to amend because on December 3, 2009, the Middle District of
Florida (District Judge John Steele) entered an Order dismissing with prejudice an
amended complaint virtually identical to Plaintiff’s amended complaint, and Plaintiff
fears the same fate. See Herriman v. United States, No. 2:08-cv-807-FtM-29DNF (2009
WL 4667404 December 3, 2009) (a copy of which is attached hereto as Ex. 1). Four days
later, on December 7, 2009, Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Timothy issued a Report and
Recommendation that an equally frivolous complaint be dismissed for failure to state a
meritorious claim. See Nelson v. United States, No. 3:08-cv-00508-MCR-EMT (N.D.
Fla.) (dkt 33) (a copy of which is attached hereto as Ex. 2). Not surprising, Messrs.
Herriman and Nelson have filed identical motions for leave to amend their pleadings in
those cases.
ARGUMENT
Plaintiff seeks leave to amend his complaint for a second time, and, relying upon
the Supreme Court’s decision in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), argues that
leave to amend pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2) should be freely given when justice so requires
and “unless the opposing party can show prejudice, bad faith, or undue delay.” Motion,
at 2 (¶¶ 6, 7). Plaintiff has not completely set forth the Foman standard. True, under
Foman leave to file an amended pleading should be freely given, but only “in the absence
of any apparent or declared reason – such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on
the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously
allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,
futility of amendment, etc.” Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Plaintiff’s Motion implicates at
3

Case 1:08-cv-00212-MP-AK Document 29

Filed 01/05/10 Page 4 of 8

least three of the Foman factors: undue delay, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
prior amendments, and futility.
Plaintiff does not detail the reason for his delay in seeking this amendment except
to state that he “moved to amend as soon as it became apparent that the amendment was
necessary.” Motion, at 3 (¶ 11). As explained above, the likely reason Plaintiff now
seeks to amend is the Middle District of Florida’s recent dismissal of an amended
complaint that is virtually identical to Plaintiff’s amended complaint. Indeed, the
plaintiff in that case has also file a motion for leave to file amended pleading, proposing
to amend his complaint in a manner virtually identical to that proposed by Plaintiff here.
See Herriman v. United States, No. 2:08-cv-807-FtM-29DNF (Motion for Leave to File
Amended Pleading) (dkt 41). Plaintiff argues that the Court should allow a second
amendment to his complaint, because “no new facts are put at issue and no new theories
of recovery are raised.” Motion, at 3 (¶ 9). Plaintiff therefore argues that the Court
should allow Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint to include “narrowly framed
pleadings” that do nothing more than to re-assert the very same argument that he has
already pled and briefed – that the pay that Plaintiff received as a driver for UPS is not
subject to the federal income tax because it is not wages, Plaintiff is not an employee, and
UPS is not engaged in a trade or business, as those terms are defined in certain provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code. See Motion, at 1 (¶ 3), 3 (¶¶ 9-11). Thus, Plaintiff’s
motion should be denied.
As an initial matter, Plaintiff’s motion is untimely. The Court’s June 30th Order
(dkt 23) specified that motions to amend pleadings were required to be filed no later than
August 17, 2009. Plaintiff’s motion was filed nearly 4 months after this deadline. And
4
5036212.1

Case 1:08-cv-00212-MP-AK Document 29

Filed 01/05/10 Page 5 of 8

Plaintiff offers no basis for his delay. Plaintiff only did so after an identical complaint
was dismissed by another Court. Such strategic delay is inexcusable. See, e.g., Senger
Bros. Nursery, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 184 F.R.D. 674, 678 (M.D. Fla.
1999) (“motions for leave to amend filed after the district court’s deadline as set forth in
the scheduling order should be denied”). Moreover, Plaintiff has already once amended
his complaint, in response to the United States’ first motion to dismiss. That amendment
failed to correct the defects in Plaintiff’s claims, and such repeated failures alone can
constitute a basis for denial of a motion for leave to amend. See Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.
More important, Plaintiff’s motion is utterly futile. Unlike the typical litigant
seeking to amend a prior pleading, Plaintiff wishes to plead “no new facts” and “no new
theories of recovery.” Motion, at 3 (¶ 9). Rather, Plaintiff wishes to “frame the issues
more succinctly.” Id. But, the claim that Plaintiff now makes is the very same claim that
he made in his original complaint, his first amended complaint, and his motion for
summary judgment. It has been extensively briefed. As explained in the United States’
filings, Plaintiff’s claim that his pay is not subject to the income tax has been held to be
frivolous time and again, and has been held sactionable by the Eleventh Circuit. See,
e.g., Motes v. United States, 785 F.2d 928, 928 (11th Cir. 1986); Biermann v. Comm’r,
769 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir. 1985); Sullivan v. United States, 788 F.2d 813, 815 (1st Cir.
1986); Peth v. Breitzmann, 611 F. Supp. 50, 53 (E.D. Wis. 1985).
The amendment proposed by Plaintiff would do nothing to change this result, and
the second amended complaint would be subject to dismissal for the same reasons set
forth in our motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. The Eleventh Circuit “‘has
found that denial of leave to amend is justified by futility when the complaint as amended
5
5036212.1

Case 1:08-cv-00212-MP-AK Document 29

Filed 01/05/10 Page 6 of 8

is still subject to dismissal.’” Hall v. United Ins. Co. Of America, 367 F.3d 1255, 1262-63
(11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1320 (11th Cir.
1999)). Thus, in Hall, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s denial of a motion
for leave to amend on the ground of futility where “the three new claims asserted, like
those in [movant’s] first amended complaint, would have been subject to dismissal as a
matter of law.” Id.
Here, by his own admission, Plaintiff does not even assert any new claims.
Rather, Plaintiff simply wishes to re-argue (more succinctly, according to Plaintiff) his
assertion that his pay is not taxable. Plaintiff argued this point both in his opposition to
the United States’ motion to dismiss or for summary judgment (dkt 20), and in his own
motion for summary judgment (comprising at least 10 pages of argument based upon the
same statutes he now cites) (dkt 24). Plaintiff apparently believes that by more narrowly
pleading his claim, he can somehow cure its defects. But he cannot. Despite Plaintiff’s
wish to more narrowly focus his pleadings, his claim for relief remains exactly what it
was when Plaintiff initiated this suit in October, 2008 – a frivolous, tax-defier assertion of
exemption from the federal income tax. For this reason, Plaintiff’s reliance on Foman is
entirely misplaced. As the Supreme Court there held, a plaintiff “ought to be afforded an
opportunity to test his claim on the merits,” but only “[i]f the underlying facts or
circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief.” Foman, 371
U.S. at 182 (emphasis added). The underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by
Plaintiff here – in his original complaint, his first amended complaint, and now his
proposed second amended complaint – are all the same, and are not a proper subject of
relief. No matter how many times Plaintiff amends his complaint, or how narrowly he

Filed 01/05/10 Page 7 of 8

pleads this claim, Plaintiff simply cannot render the pay that he received in exchange for
his services as a driver exempt from the federal income tax.
CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave
to File Amended Pleading.
