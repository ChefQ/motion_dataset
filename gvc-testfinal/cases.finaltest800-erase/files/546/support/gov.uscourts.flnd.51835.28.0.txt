STEVEN MARTINS,

Plaintiff.
Vv. Case No. 1:08-cv-00212-MP-AK

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Defendant.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED PLEADING
AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

Plaintiff requests leave of court to file an amended pleading, PLAINTIFF'S

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT.
A. Introduction

1. Plaintiff is Steven Martins; defendant is United States of America.

2. Plaintiff sued defendant under 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7422 for refund of overpayment of taxes

in accordance with the accounting on the face of plaintiff's tax returns for the years

2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

3. Grounds for plaintiff's claim are the definitions of "wages", "employee", "trade or

business", and others in 26 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 3401, 3121 and 7701 applied to the material
facts.

4. Defendant has not filed an answer.

5. Plaintiff seeks to amend his complaint to include the following: (1) narrowly framed

pleadings conforming to the decision in Brigham v. United States, 160 F.3d 759 (1st

Filed] PoeP Ol isticF ini ana
Case 1:08-cv-00212-MP-AK Document 28 Filed 12/28/09 Page 2 of 5

Cir. 1998) that the interpretive canon noscitur a sociis applies to the term "includes"
as defined at 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7701(c); (2) narrowly framed pleadings conforming to the
decision in Mason v. Barnhart, 406 F.3d 962 (8th Cir. 2005) regarding burden of
proof at 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6201(d); and (3) deletion ail statements which could be
construed or misconstrued as grounds for denying plaintiff remedy or dismissing his
complaint.

B. Argument
. Unless the opposing party can show prejudice, bad faith, or undue delay, a court
should grant leave to file an amended pleading. Foman y. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182
(1962).
. Leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P.
15(a\(2); Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Although plaintiff's motion to amend comes after
the pretrial scheduling order deadline of August 17, 2009 for amending pleadings, the
defendant has not yet answered plaintiff's complaint, and plaintiff has learned
through review of the pleadings that is appropriate and necessary for plaintiff to
correct the allegations in his complaint to frame the issues more succinctly in
conformity with the case law upon which plaintiff relies, and to delete superfluous
statements and issues.
. The court should allow the filing of plaintiff's amended pleading because it is
appropriate and necessary. See Gamma-I0 Plastics, Inc. v. Am. President Lines, Ltd,
32 F.3d 1244, 1255-56 (8th Cir. 1994). Plaintiff will be prejudiced if not allowed to

amend.

Defendant will not be prejudiced by plaintiff's amended pleading because no new
facts are put at issue and no new theories of recovery are raised. The amended
pleading merely corrects the allegations in the complaint to frame the issues more
succinctly in conformity with the case law upon which plaintiff relies, and deletes
superfluous statements and issues. See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231,
243 (4th Cir. 1999) (moting that merely adding specificity to allegations generally
does not cause prejudice to the opposing party); Laber, 438 F.3d at 427; see also
Davis v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 615 F.2d 606, 613 (4th Cir. 1980) ("Because defendant
was from the outset made fully aware of the events giving rise to the action, an
allowance of the amendment could not in any way prejudice the preparation of
defendant's case.").

Defendant will not be prejudiced by any delay that plaintiff's amended pleading may
cause. See Auster Oil & Gas, Inc. v. Stream, 764 F.2d 381, 391 (5th Cir. 1985).
Plaintiff's amendment is likely to speed up the progress of the case towards
adjudication on the merits and to avert the need for an appeal.

Plaintiff diligently moved to amend as soon it became apparent that the amendment
was necessary. See Auster Oil & Gas, Inc. vy. Stream, 764 F.2d 381, 391 (5th Cir.
1985). Plaintiff filed this motion immediately upon learning that he needed to correct
the allegations in his complaint to frame the issues more succinctly in conformity
with the case law upon which plaintiff relies, and to delete superfluous statements and
issues,

Plaintiff is filing his amended pleading separately along with this motion.

C. Conclusion
13. It is appropriate and necessary for plaintiff to narrowly reframe his pleadings in close
conformity to the case law in support of plaintiff's claim for relief, as found in
Brigham v. United States, 160 F.3d 759 (1st Cir. 1998), and Mason v. Barnhart, 406
F.3d 962 (8th Cir. 2005), so that plaintiff may achieve justice in this matter. The
filing of an amended complaint will not prejudice the defendant. For these reasons,

plaintiff asks the court to grant leave to file the amended pleading.
