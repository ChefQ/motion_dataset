Defendant Is Not an Instrumentality of the State
The Defendant asserts that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the Eleventh
Amendment. The Plaintiff asserts that the Eleventh Amendment is not applicable to the
claims raised by the Plaintiff because the University of Missouri is not an instrumentality

of the State of Missouri.

The federal courts last considered whether the University of Missouri is an
instrumentality of the state in 1994. Sherman v. The Curators of the University of
Missouri, 870 F. Supp. 344 (W. Dist. Missouri 1994). Much has changed since that time.
Plaintiff refers the Court to the University of Missouri website where it makes its detailed
and public disclosure of its budget. See, "FY11 MU Budget Snapshot." at
http://mubudget.missouri.edu. Plaintiff has attached Exhibit A which is an excerpt from the
web site that sets out the State's contribution to the University of Missouri and Exhibit B
which is an excerpt that sets out the amount of federal funding.

In Sherman v. The Curators of the University of Missouri, 870 F. Supp. 344 (W.
Dist. Missouri 1994) the District Court quoted from Greenwood v. Ross, 778 F. 2d 448
(8" Cir. Arkansas 1985 ), "Each state University must be considered on the basis of its
own particular circumstances and determining if the University is a state instrumentality
that enjoys the protection of the Eleventh Amendment." The Eighth Circuit has identified
two critical factors to be examined in making this determination. Sherman v. Curators of
the University of Missouri, 16 F.3d 860, 864 (8th Cir. 1994). (Emphasis added). Those
factors are the University's level of autonomy and, most importantly, whether any
judgment rendered against the defendant will be paid by state funds. (Citations omitted).

Id. at p. 346.

3
Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 3 of 16
The District Court went on to note that the state Constitution requires the
legislature to "adequately maintain" the University. In 1994, the District Court noted that
the state of Missouri contributed 31.3% of the University's total revenues. Id. at p. 346.
The District Court held in 1994 that any judgment against the University will ultimately be
derived from the state treasury and therefore the University is entitled to Eleventh
Amendment immunity. Id. at p. 348.

In Romero v. Institute of Puerto Rican culture, 466 F. Supp. 2d 410 (Dist. Puerto
Rico 2006) the court noted that, Whether an entity is an arm of the state and thus
protected by the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity is a question of federal law. Id. at
p. 419. However, since "even without an explicit promise, the Commonwealth may have
assumed this obligation [to pay for the entity's debts] by binding itself to provide virtually
all of the funds that [the entity] needs to operate..." Id. at p. 421 .... The court held that the
percentage of the [the entity]'s budget that the Commonwealth provides is so sizable (96%)
so as to `virtually provide' all of the [the entity]'s funds Id. at p. 422

In Infomath, Inc. v. University of Arkansas, 630 F. Supp. 2d 674 (Dist. Arkansas
2007) the District Court quoted that "Courts typically look at the degree of local autonomy
and control and most importantly whether the funds to pay any award will be derived from
the state treasury." (Citations omitted). Id. at p. 677.

The University of Missouri's current budget is approximately $1.9 billion. The
University's website reveals that of this amount approximately $179 million is contributed
by the state of Missouri. It can no longer be said that the State "adequately maintains" the
University of Missouri. This amount is less than 10% then the total University budget.

Federal contributions amount to $370 million or almost 20% of the University's total

4
Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 4 of 16
budget. Accordingly, at this time, the University is more of an instrumentality of the
federal government than the State government. Therefore, Plaintiff submits that Sherman is
no longer controlling and that the University of Missouri is no longer an instrumentality of
the State of Missouri for purposes of the analysis of Eleventh Amendment immunity. Thus,

the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to the Plaintiff's claims in this case.

No Eleventh Amendment Immunity Because No State Remedies

If the Court finds that the University of Missouri is an instrumentality of the State
of Missouri, in order for a state to constitutionally avail itself of Eleventh Amendment
immunity, the state must provide "adequate" remedies under state law.

In Jacobs v. Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau, 710 F. Supp. 2d 663 ( W.
Dist. Tennessee 2010) the District Court noted that the United States Supreme Court in
Florida Prepaid made clear that a State's infringement of a patent is not a per se
constitutional violation. (Citations omitted). The United States Supreme Court stated
"Instead, only where the state provides no remedy, or only inadequate remedies, to injured
patent owners for its infringement of their patent could a deprivation of property without
due process result. (Emphasis added). Id. at p. 673 - 674.

In Marketing Information Masters, Inc. v. The board of Trustees of the California
State University System, 552 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (S. Dist. CA. 2008) the court stated
"According to the Fifth Circuit in Chavez, the relevant inquiry for determining whether the
CRCA constitutes a valid exercise of Congress's Fourteenth Amendment powers is: (1)
whether there is a pattern of copyright infringement by states; (2) whether adequate state

remedies for copyright infringement exists; and (3) the coverage of the legislation. Id. at

Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 5 of 16
p. 1094. Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, 204 F. 3d 601 (5% Cir. 2000); Pennington Seed,
Inc. v. Produce Exchange No. 299, 457 F.3d 1334 (8" Cir. Mo. 2006).

The Plaintiff's claims arise under VARA. The Plaintiff submits that the State of
Missouri has provided no rights to the author of a work of visual art, no copyright
protection nor any common law causes of action for the protection of the author of a work
of visual art. Therefore, the State of Missouri's defense of Eleventh Amendment sovereign

immunity fails under the facts and circumstances of this case.

The Tiger Spot Is Protected by VARA

The Defendant argues in its Suggestions that the Tiger Spot is not a "work of visual
art." The Defendant sites VARA as providing protection to "a painting, drawing, print or
sculpture ..." The Defendant states that the Tiger Spot is a mosaic and that the Tiger Spot
is "none of these things." However, Plaintiff submits that Defendant's assertion is not
correct.

The Tiger Spot is a work of visual art and falls under the protection of VARA as "a
painting, drawing, print or sculpture .... "" 17 USC Section 101. The Congressional
Record of VARA's legislative history instructs Courts to interpret the definition of a work

of visual art as follows:

use common sense and generally accepted standards of the
artistic Community in determining whether a particular work
falls within the scope of the definition [of "work of visual
art"]. Artists may work in a variety of media, and use any

number of materials in creating their works. Therefore,

6
Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 6 of 16
whether a particular work falls within the definition should
not depend on the medium or materials used. Phillips v.
Pembroke Real Estate, Inc,. 459 F.3d 128, 136 (1" Cir.

Mass. 2006) quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101-514, at 6.

Again the Court is directed to consider the media and materials of the artist broadly
and not interpret the five categories narrowly as art is a matter of creativity and
imagination that seeks to extend traditional boundaries. As such the Tiger Spot exists in
the grand tradition of visual art and is clearly included in the in the scope of VARA as a
"drawing" and as a "sculpture."

Thus, the fact that the medium and materials consist of tiles embedded into a
laticrete base does not prevent the Tiger Spot from simply being a drawing. In addition,
the Tiger Spot is clearly included in the definition of a "sculpture"? when VARA's
legislative history is considered in making the determination.

The tiger mosaic is not merely a two dimensional representation of a Tiger as the
Defendant asserts. The Tiger Spot does have three dimensions. The tiles embedded in the
laticrete give the mosaic a three dimensional quality. While the Tiger Spot may not be
capable of being seen in its three dimensions that is not a requirement for sculpture. A
"relief" is a well recognized form of sculpture although it is not capable of being seen in
360 degrees. A relief is three dimensional in the same way that the Tiger Spot is three
dimensional. The Congress's direction to consider the categories in their broader sense
leads to the unmistakable conclusion that Tiger Spot is a work or visual art protected under
several categories and is therefore exactly the type of work of visual art intended to be

protected by VARA.

Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 7 of 16
Several cases have dealt with mosaics and no case has excluded mosaics from the
scope of VARA In Phillips vy. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128 (10x00B0 Cir. Ct. App.
Massachusetts 2006) the artist designed and installed stone walls, granite stones inlaid
into the Park's walkways, and other landscape design elements. Id. at p. 130-131. The First
Circuit found that the works themselves were included under VARA (although the court
found that they constituted site - specific art and thus not protected by VARA)

In Carter v. Helmsley - Spear, Inc., 71 F. 3 d 77 (20x2122 Cir. Ct. App. N. Y. 1995) the
work of art consisted of "a variety of sculptural elements constructed from recycled
materials, much of it metal, affixed to the walls and ceiling, and a vast mosaic made from
pieces of recycled glass embedded in the floor and walls. Id. at p. 80. The Second Circuit
found this work to come within the definition of a work of visual art. Id. at p. 84.

Thus, the Plaintiff has met his threshold burden of pleading sufficient facts to bring

the Tiger Spot under the VARA definition of a work of visual art.

The Tiger Spot is Not Site - Specific
The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant is misapplying the phrase "site - specific"
in the context of VARA. The Defendant seems to be arguing that the Tiger Spot is affixed
to the ground and is therefore "site - specific" and does not fall under the protections of
VARA. Plaintiff submits that this analysis is not correct.
It is correct that VARA does not apply to "site - specific" art. VARA does not even

mention site - specific art.

[S]ite - specific art... is asubset of "Integrated rt." A

work of "integrated art" is comprised of two or more

8
Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 8 of 16
physical objects that must be presented together as the artist
intended for the work to retain its meaning and integrity. In a
work of "site-specific" art one of the component physical
objects is the location of the art. To remove a work of "site -
specific" art from its original site is to destroy it. Phillips v.
Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128, 129 (10x00B0 Cir.

Massachusetts 2006).

Therefore, if site - specific art is removed from the site, the art it destroyed
because the location is an element of the work of art itself. The point is that site - specific
art is not physically destroyed by moving it but artistically destroyed because the location
is an integral part of the art.

In Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128 (1% Cir. Ct. App.
Massachusetts 2006) Phillips contracted to provide various art in a park near the Boston
Harbor. He designed and installed ocean themed sculptures, walls, paths and various other
ocean themed elements.

The Court noted that ".... for site - specific art, the location of the work is an
integral element of the work. Because the location of the work contributes to its meaning,
site-specific art is destroyed if it is moved him its original site. (Citations omitted) "it is
clear that the community of respected American artists and art authorities regard crafted
work and the site or sites specific artworks as an indivisible whole. The artists who create
these works explain that the meaning and purpose behind the art lie squarely within its

physical location." Id. at p. 134.

9
Case 2:11-cv-04023-MJW Document12 Filed 06/02/11 Page 9 of 16
The work of visual art that was the subject of the Phillips case is site specific
because it was created and placed in a location close to the ocean and its removal to some
other location would destroy it as a work of art.

It should be noted here that VARA contains a "public presentation exception" that

provides as follows:

The modification of a work of visual art which is the result
ot conservation, or of the public presentation, including
lighting and placement, of the work is not a destruction,
distortion, mutilation, or other modification described in
subsection (a)(3) unless the modification is caused by gross

negligence. 17 U.S.C. S 106(c)(2)

The public presentation exception defines the types of changes, such as those in
lighting and placement, that do not constitute "destruction, distortion, or mutilation". Id. at
p. 141. Thus, VARA allows a work of visual art to be moved without liability unless the
work is damaged in the move as a result of gross negligence. The public presentation
exception does not apply to site - specific art because VARA does not apply to site -
specific art at all. Phillips at p. 129.

In Bd. of Managers of Soho International Arts Condo. v. City of New York 2003
USS. Dist. LEXIS 10221, No. 01-1226, 2003 WL 21403333 at *19 *(S.D.N.Y. 2003) the
Court stated that VARA's objective "is not ... to preserve a work of visual art where it is,
but rather to preserve the work as it is". Id. at p. 138. The Plaintiff agrees with this

statement and submits that it supports the Plaintiffs position that the location of the Tiger
