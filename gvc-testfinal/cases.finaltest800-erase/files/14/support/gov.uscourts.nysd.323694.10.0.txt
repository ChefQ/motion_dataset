MOTION FOR CONSOLIDATION

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a), detendant Starbucks Corporation
("Starbucks") hereby moves for the consolidation of Harayda v. Starbucks Corporation, Civil
Action No. 7:08-cv-4182-WCC, currently pending before Judge William C. Conner in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with the prior-filed and related
instant action, Barenboim v. Starbucks Corporation. Civil Action No. 1:08-cv-3318-LTS.
Starbucks so moves with the consent of counsel for plaintiff Harayda.

Haravda and Barenboim present virtually identical factual and legal claims. Accordingly,
Starbucks respectfully submits, with the consent of Harayda, that judicial economy and
efficiency are best served by consolidating the Harayda action with the prior-filed Barenboim
action for all purposes.

[. BACKGROUND

The Barenboim action was filed on April 3, 2008 in the United States District Court for

the Southern District of New York and was assigned to this Court. (See Barenboim Complaint,

Dkt. 1.) The /fareyde litigation was filed one week later, on April 10, 2008, in the Supreme
Case 1:08-cv-03318-LTS-JCF Document10 Filed 05/27/2008 Page2of5

Court of New York, Westchester County. (/farayda Complaint (attached hereto as Ex. 1).) On
May 1, 2008, Starbucks timely removed Haravda to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. (See Harayda v. Starbucks Corp. Docket, S.D.N-Y. Case No.
7:08-cv-4182-WCC.) The case was subsequently assigned to Judge William C. Conner, who
presides in the White Plains courthouse for the Southern District of New York.

Plaintiffs in both cases are former entry-level "baristas" who allege that Starbucks
violated New York Labor Law by allowing the shift supervisors who worked with baristas to
receive a portion of the gratuities left in tip containers located in Starbucks stores. (See
Barenboim Amended Complaint (Dkt. 4) 49] 15-26; Haravda Complaint 4] 7-19, 27-35.) The
classes the Barenboim and Harayda plaintiffs seek to represent are virtually identical. The
plaintiffs in the Barenboim action seek to certify a class of all baristas employed by Starbucks in
the state of New York on or after April 3, 2002. (Barenboim Amended Complaint 4 7.) Plaintiff
in Harayda seeks to represent a class of all citizens of New York employed by Starbucks in New
York since April 10, 2002 and who shared tips with shift supervisors or other alleged agents of
Starbucks.' (flarayda Complaint 0x00A7 20.)

I. CONSOLIDATION OF BARENBOIM AND HARAYDA IS PROPER PURSUANT
TO FED. R. CIV. P. 42

Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the consolidation of actions
where they "involve a common question of law or fact" in order to avoid "unnecessary costs or

delay." Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a): Johnson v. Celotex Corp., 899 F.2d 1281, 1284 (2d Cir. 1990).

' Currently pending before this Court is another action seeking to represent a class of
employees claiming that Starbucks tip policies are unlawful. The plaintiffs in Lawrence, et al. v,
Starbucks Corporation, Civil Action No. 1:08-cv-3734-LTS, seek to represent Starbucks assistant
store managers, among others, and allege they should be included within the group of emplovees
who receive gratuities from the tip containers in the company's stores.

District courts have broad discretion to determine whether consolidation is appropriate. /d. at
1285: see also Maicolm v. Nat'l Gypsum Co., 995 F.2d 346, 350 (2d Cir. 1993). Courts within
the Southern District have encouraged consolidation of actions if there is substantial overlap,
even where cases are not identical. See, e.g.. in re Fuwei Films Sec. Lit., 247 F.R.D. 432, 435
(S.D.N.Y. 2008).

The allegations, proposed classes, and legal claims asserted in Barenboim and Harayda
are virtually identical. Both sets of plaintiffs allege similar facts and bring their claims under the
same provisions of New York Labor Law. The cases also involve common questions of law and
fact that are best determined in a single proceeding. Furthermore, the adjudication of these
matters together avoids any danger of inconsistent verdicts, should both of these matters proceed
to trial or be decided on summary judgment. Finally, Starbucks, as the defendant, would face
unnecessary costs, burden and prejudice by having to simultaneously defend against two
overlapping Rule 23 class actions asserting identical claims and failure to consolidate may also
result in a waste of judicial resources. Accordingly, consolidation of {/arayda with the
Barenboim action is proper. See, e.g., in re Fuwei Films, 247 F.R.D. at 435 (consolidating class
actions with similar claims); Reimer v. Ambac Fin. Grp., Inc., 2008 WL 2073931, at *1
(S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2008) (same).

Ill. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Starbucks, with the consent of counsel for plaintiff Harayda,
respectfully requests that the Court consolidate Harayda v. Starbucks Corporation, Civil Action
No, 7:08-cv-4182-WCC, currently pending before Judge William C. Conner in the United States

District Court for the Southern District of New York, with the prior-filed and related instant
