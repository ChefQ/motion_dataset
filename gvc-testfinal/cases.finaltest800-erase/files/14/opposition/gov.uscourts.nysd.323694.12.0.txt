DECLARATION OF MICHELE F. RAPHAEL IN RESPONSE TO
STARBUCKS CORPORATION’S MOTION FOR CONSOLIDATION
I, MICHELE F. RAPHAEL, duly licensed to practice law before the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, do hereby declare as follows:
1.

I am a partner of the law firm of Wolf Popper LLP, counsel for plaintiff Julianna

Harayda in the action captioned Harayda v. Starbucks Corpation, Civil Action No. 7:08-cv–4182
(WCC), currently pending before the Honorable William C. Conner, in the United States District
Court for the Southern District, White Plains (the “Harayda” action). I have personal knowledge
of the facts and circumstances stated herein.
2.

I submit this declaration in response to Starbucks Corporation’s Motion to

Consolidate the Harayda action with Barenboim v. Starbucks Corporation, Civil Action No. 08cv-3318 (LTS) (the “Barenboim” action), pending in this Court before the Honorable Laura T.
Swain. I agree that the two cases should be consolidated because they both concern who is
entitled to share in the tip pool.
3.

In addition, there is a third case, Lawrence v. Starbucks Corporation, Civil
Action

No. 08-cv-03734 (LTS) (the “Lawrence” action) which also challenges Starbucks’ tip pooling
policy. A copy of the complaint in the Lawrence action is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. While
mentioned in a footnote in Defendant’s motion to consolidate, Defendant did not ask to
consolidate this case with Barenboim and Harayda. However, the Lawerence action, as the
Harayda and Barenboim actions, alleges claims under the New York Labor Law and concerns
who at Starbucks, is entitled to share in the tips. The Barenboim action is brought on behalf of
baristas, the Harayda action is brought on behalf of Starbucks employees who shared tips with

supervisors or other agents of Starbucks, and the Lawrence action claims that trainees and
assistant store managers should share in tips. Hence, the overriding common issue in all three
cases is who is entitled to share in tip pooling - under both Starbucks’ policy and New York
Labor Law. To decide the same issue in separate cases would be a waste of judicial resources.
Moreover, the Lawrence action is already pending before the Honorable Judge Swain and was
filed as, and accepted as, related to the Barenboim action. Only the Harayda action will need to
be transferred.
4.

If, and once, the cases are consolidated, plaintiff Harayada respectfully requests

that an initial conference be scheduled.
