1 NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff and Third Party Defendant Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. .
("Durkin") filed an action against Defendant City of Newark and members of City
Council (collectively "the City") arising out of the City's improper termination of
Durkin's Contract. Durkin files this Motion in Limine to preclude the City from offering
evidence or arguments that the method for paying for incomplete work under the
Contract is other than on a time and materials basis, as was testified to by the City's
designee pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 30(b)(6).
I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The City designated and produced Carol Houck, Assistant City Administrator, as
its Rule 30(b)(6) witness for deposition. (Selected portions Carol Houck 3/23/06 Deposition,
page 183, lines 11-19, App. A3). During the deposition, Houck testified how the City
interpreted the Contract provisions with respect to payment for incomplete work under
the Contract as of the date the Contract was terminated by the City. The City is bound by
its Rule 30(b)(6) designee's testimony, and this motion is being filed to preclude the City
from changing its position on this issue and offering evidence or arguments of a method
for calculating payment for incomplete work under the Contract.
Il. CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS
During the deposition of Carol Houck, Ms. Houck was asked how under the
Contract the City was to pay for incomplete work up to the date of termination. (Selected
portions Carol Houck 3/30/06 Deposition, page 668-669, lines 24-11, App. A6). Houck

responded that all incomplete work was to be paid on a time and materials basis. (App

A6, Page 668-669, lines 24-11).

KOP:346553v2 3514-04
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document194 Filed 08/22/2006 Page5of7

Subsequent to her deposition, Houck prepared very detailed errata sheets that
contained extensive changes or "clarifications" to her testimony. (App. A7-A13). Notably,
Houck did not attempt to change or "clarify" the testimony on how incomplete work was
to be paid under the Contract, and the City has never attempted to amend, change or
clarify the testimony of its Rule 30(b)(6) designee.

| IV. ARGUMENT
A. The City is Bound by its Designee's Testimony Indicating that
Incomplete Work under the Contract is to be Paid on a Time and
Materials Basis

The City is bound by its designee's testimony. Jerardi v. Lorillard, 1991 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 1320 (E.D. Pa. 1991). The City cannot proffer new or different allegations or
testimony at the time of trial that could have been made at the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition.
See Rainey v. Amer. Forrest & Paper Ass'n, 26 F. Supp. 2d 82 (D. D.C. 1998). The purpose of
Rule 30(b)(6) is to bind the party to the positions taken by its designee, insulating the
other party from "trial by ambush." /d. at 95. The Advisory Note to Rule 30(b)(6)
indicates that Rule 30(b)(6) will "curb the `bandying' by which officers or managing

agents of [an organization] are deposed in turn but each disclaims knowledge of facts that
are clearly known to persons in the organization and thereby to it." Advisory Note to Fed.
R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6).

Ms. Houck, as the City's 30(b)(6) designee, is not testifying as to Aer personal
opinions, but rather she is testifying as to the City's "position" on the topic. See e.g.
America v. Taylor, et al., 166 F.R.D. 356 (M.D. N.C. 1996). Moreover, an organization must
provide its interpretation of documents and does so through its 30(b){6) designee. /d. at
361. At her deposition, Ms. Houck testified that all incomplete work is to be paid for on a

time and materials basis up through the date of termination. (App. A6). That

2
KOP:346553 v2 3514-04
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 194 Filed 08/22/2006 Page6of7

interpretation has not been challenged, questioned or otherwise disavowed by the City at
any time since Ms. Houck's deposition, and consequently the City must be precluded at
the time of trial from offering evidence or arguments of a method for calculating payment
for incomplete work that differs from its Rule 30(b)(6) designee's testimony.

B. Durkin will be Highly Prejudiced if the City is Permitted to Change

its Position Regarding How Incomplete Work is to be Paid Under the
Contract

Subsequent to the 30{b)(6) deposition, Ms. Houck prepared deposition errata
sheets with extensive changes and "clarifications" to her deposition testimony. (App. A7-
A13). However, Ms. Houck did not attempt to change or clarify her testimony on how
incomplete work was to be paid under the Contract. Moreover, the City never attempted
to amend Ms. Houck's testimony or present a different 30(b)(6) designee to "clarify" or
change the City's position.

Assuming arguendo that the City disagreed with the method of payment that
Houck testified to as the City's interpretation of the Contract on this issue, the City had a
duty under Rule 26(e)(2) to amend its response. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2)(B). If the City
intended to advance a different interpretation through Ms. Houck or any other City witness at the
time of trial, the City's failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing
concealment. Jerardi v. Lorillard, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1320 (E.D. Pa. 1991).

Durkin agrees with Houck's interpretation that regardless of whether the City
breached the Contract, all incomplete work is to be paid for on a time and materials basis.
Because there is consensus between the City and Durkin on how incomplete work is to be
paid for, Durkin did not, and indeed had no reason to, retain the services of a construction
contract expert to provide an opinion on contract interpretation for payment for
incomplete work. Because the deadline for expert designations has long since past for

Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 194 Filed 08/22/2006 Page /7of7

Durkin, it would be highly prejudicial, and contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and decisional law, to permit the City to argue or present evidence of a method
for payment for incomplete work that differs from what was testified to by its 30(b)(6)
designee'.
Vv. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

For the reasons set forth above, Defendant Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc.
respectfully requests that this Court grant its Motion in Limine and preclude the City
from presenting evidence or arguments of a method for calculating payment for
incomplete work other than on a time and matenials basis.

' Under Delaware Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 30(b)(6) (which is similar to Federal Rule
30(b)(6)) the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling prohibiting testimony
that was contrary to the 30(b)(6) designee's testimony on two bases. See Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Comp., Inc., et al., 866 A. 2d 1, 2005 Del. LEXIS 41 (Del.
Sup. Ct. 2005). First, the new proffered testimony would reverse all prior positions on the issue
and second, the reversal in position would be highly prejudicial. /d.
