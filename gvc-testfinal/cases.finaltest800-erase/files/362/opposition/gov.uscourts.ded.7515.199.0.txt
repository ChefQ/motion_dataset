STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin (“Durkin”) has asserted a breach of contract, various tort
claims and a civil rights claim against the City of Newark and Individual Defendants
(cumulatively “Newark”). Durkin seeks to have its damages determined on a time and materials
basis due to a comment made by Newark’s 30(b)(6) designee.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Durkin has mischaracterized and taken out of context a response by Newark’s designee as
support for its alternative theory for damages, which theory is neither supported by the contract
nor the law.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Durkin and the City entered into a contract for the amount of $9,679,000. When the
project was approximately 70% complete, Durkin’s contract was terminated. Durkin was paid
for most of the work completed, but the final few payment applications were held by the City due
to the termination, as was its right under the contract. Durkin contends that it is entitled, in part,
to over five million dollars in damages which represent its actual costs to perform the entire
project, plus re-calculated inflated equipment rates. Durkin is offering a comment made by
Newark’s designee to support its theory.
ARGUMENT
If Durkin is entitled to any damages, the damages should be determined by the contract.
Reference is made to the City of Newark’s Motion in Limine as to Valuation of Plaintiff’s
Damages which is incorporated herein, and which explains the contractual and legal authority for

valuing damages. Durkin advances a creative theory of damages, that is, in the event of wrongful
termination the contract should be ignored, as should the payments Newark has made to Durkin
to date. Durkin believes that the work performed should be re-valued and paid for according to
new rates. This theory is contrary to the damages outlined by the termination provisions of the
contract, and contrary to established law regarding damages in a breach of construction contract
action.
In support of its theory, Durkin has fixated on one line of testimony out of over 750
pages. On the fourth day of questioning, Newark’s designee, Carol Houck, testified:

Q.

A.

Do you know what the contract provides as far as how to pay for
incomplete work?
Percentages, I believe.
You didn't understand that incomplete work is paid on a time and material
basis up to the time of termination?
Yes.
That is the method of paying for incomplete work. Is that correct?
Yes.
So all incomplete work for Durkin should be, for purposes of calculating
what they were entitled to be paid up to the date of termination, would be
on a time and material basis. Correct?
That's my under -- that's my recollection.

(Exhibit A).
Ms. Houck was obviously referring to time and materials under the contract, as her
references to “percentages” indicates. Contractors invoice on a percentage completion basis
based on the contract value. Durkin had been paid, up to the time of termination, on that basis of
percentage completion (Exhibit B, Contract, Article 5). Ms. Houck’s cited testimony was not
prefaced by any questioning regarding damages to be paid to Durkin or the termination and it is
patently unfair to use the response out-of-context in that manner.

Durkin’s citation to Fed. Rule C.P. 26(e) is misplaced. The response by Ms. Houck is so
obviously not related to the damages sought by Durkin, that amendment is not necessary, nor was
it even contemplated. (As to Ms. Houck’s Errata Sheet, reference is made the City of Newark’s
Response to Federal’s Motion in Limine To Exclude the Deposition of Errata Sheets of Carol
Houck). And even if the Court should find that her response is related, Durkin would be free to
question Ms. Houck at trial on this issue.
The contract provides for the method of calculating damages, and if that is found not to
apply then the law dictates the method. The time and materials basis Durkin is advancing is
prohibited, notwithstanding the misuse of Ms. Houck’s testimony.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant City of Newark respectfully requests that this Court deny
Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine to Preclude the City from Offering Evidence That The Method for
Payment for Incomplete Work is Different Than What Its Rule 30(b)(6) Designee Indicated.
