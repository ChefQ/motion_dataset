participating in the action have been made. This conduct is violative of the law and needs to be
restrained, sanctions issued and explanatory notices and corrective notices sent to the members.
Summary of the Objectionable Conduct

Homebanc has warned members of the potential cost to them. Members are advised that
if they talk about pending lawsuits it is grounds for "immediate termination." They have been
told that participants in the lawsuit are being "performance managed out" of the company; hence
their livelihood is at jeopardy. Members have witnessed Plaintiffs being fired, targeted and
retaliated against; confirming HomeBanc's threats that participating in the lawsuit will result in
adverse employment action. In short, the clear message HomeBanc is sending is that if a
member participates in the lawsuit they will pay. On the heels of these threats, HomeBanc held a
mandatory meeting to discuss the instant lawsuit and solicited affidavits from members
confirming their intention not to opt-into the lawsuit.

It is clear that the point of HomeBanc's actions was to solicit as many exclusions as
possible before this Court certified the collective action in an attempt to reduce HomeBanc's
potential liability. Therefore, Plaintiff seeks to restrain, or in the alternative limit, Defendants
ex-parte communications with potential class members and that corrective notice be sent to
include, but not limited to, informing members to disregard Defendants threats of adverse
employment action, description of the lawsuit and members rights to participate in this suit.

BACKGROUND

This case is a "collective action" under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), similar
to a class action prosecuted under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23. See Belt v. Emeare, Inc.,
299 P, Supp. 2d 664 (E.D. Tex. 2003). Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of loan officers who

were not paid overtime wages in violation of 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7207(a)(1). A collective action, like a

class action, prevents piecemeal litigation, inconsistent adjudications and difficult res Judicata
issues. See Donovan y. University of Texas at El Pasco, 643 F. 2d 1201, 1206-07 6" Cir. 1981).
However, unlike a class action, in a collective action class members will not participate in the
recovery unless they specifically opt-into the class upon receiving court-supervised notice of the
pending action. See Hipp v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co, 252 F.3d 1208, 1214-15 ai(R)
Cir 2001)?

In addition to the instant case there exist eleven related cases, seven in the United States
District Court, Middle District of Florida and four in the United States District Court, Southern
District of Florida. Currently fourteen (14) of HomeBanc's current or former loan officers have
commenced related actions against it for denying them overtime to which they are statutorily
entitled,' and/or filed consents to become Parties Plaintiff in the instant case'. On May 4, 2006
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Consolidate the related cases and on the same day, Defendants filed a
Motion to Consolidate related cases filed in the Middle District. Thereafter, on May 11, 2006

Plaintiff filed a Motion for Collective Action along with a proposed notice. Said motions are

pending before this Court.

FACTS

The facts upon which this motion is based are compelling:

Ll. Of the fourteen plaintiffs who filed complaints against HomeBanc on or after
February 21, 2006 alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") five were
current employees of HomeBanc; Bradford T. King ("King"), Mark Mellman ("Mellman"),
Lucian Robinson ("Robinson"), Cary Marchand ("Marchand") and Kevin Finneran ("Finneran").

2. On or about April 2006, Nigel Fullick ("Fullick"), Assistant Vice-President, held
a mandatory meeting with all loan officers employed in HomeBanc's Naples, Florida office. At
the meeting Mr. Fullick warned loan officers that talking about lawsuits in which HomeBanc is
involved is "grounds for immediate termination." (See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Lucian Robinson;
Exhibit B, Affidavit of Cary Marchand and Exhibit C, Affidavit of Mark Mellman). He further
stated that HomeBanc is a publicly traded company and the lawsuit could affect the price of
HomeBane stock, (See Exhibits A, B and C). Mr. Fullick ended the meeting by stating that the
plaintiffs are trying to take HomeBanc down and advised loan officers not to react to anger. (See
Exhibits A, B and C).

3. Prior to becoming a party plaintiff Mr. Robinson was solicited by Mr. Fullick to
adversely affect Mr. Mellman's employment with HomeBanc. Specifically, Mr. Fullick stated
that "something has to be done to remove him from the account." (See Exhibit A). Mr. Fullick
asked Mr. Robinson to state that Mr. Meliman's performance in the AmeriVest alliance office
was inadequate. (See Exhibit A). At the time of Mr. Fullick's request, Mr. Robinson, Mr.
Meliman and Jo Beth Nicoll had worked in the AmeriVest alliance office for eleven months.
(See Exhibits A and C). This was the first time that Mr. Robinson had been asked to comment

about Mr. Mellman's job performance, which to his knowledge was satisfactory. (See Exhibit

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 32 Filed 05/25/06 Page 5 of 25

A). Prior to the time Mr. Mellman filed his Complaint his job performance had not been at issue.
(See Exhibit C), The production at AmeriVest was evaluated on a group basis rather than an
individual basis, therefore any performance deficiencies would be based upon the entire group.
(See Exhibit A and C).

4, Post filing of the Complaint, Mr. King had private conversations with Nigel
Fullick regarding the lawsuit and felt increased hostility from Mr. Fullick. Mr. King was initially
denied a request for vacation, whereas non-plaintiff similarly situated loan officers are not.

5. On Friday, May 12, 2006 Mr. Finneran was terminated from his employment with
HomeBane.

6. On Friday, May 12, 2006 Tom Flood ("Flood"), Senior Vice-President, Regional
Sales Manager, held a mandatory meeting with loan officers employed in HomeBanc's Naples,
Florida office. Mr. Flood announced that it is no secret there is a lawsuit against HomeBanc and
stated that those people who are still with the company will be "performance managed out." (See
Exhibits B and C).

7. On Thursday, May 18, 2006 Mr. Robinson submitted his resignation to Mr.
Flood. Mr. Flood offered Mr, Robinson future monetary incentives to retract his resignation and
conditioned the monetary incentives of Mr. Robinson dismissing his lawsuit. (See Exhibit A).

8. On Thursday, May 18, 2006 Mr. Flood approached Mr. Marchand and offered
him future monetary incentives to dismiss his lawsuit, (See Exhibit B).

9. On Thursday, May 18, 2006 Mr. Mellman was removed from the AmeriVest
alliance office. Ms. Nicoll, non-plaintiff, was not removed. This adverse employment action was
made public to the loan officers located in the Naples office via electronic correspondence sent

to all loan officers from Mr. Flood. (See Exhibit D).

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 32 Filed 05/25/06 Page 6 of 25

10. On Friday, May 19, 2006 HomeBanc held mandatory meetings in the N. Broward
office and the Naples(R) office with all loan officers. Mr. Mellman and Mr. Marchand were
contacted prior to the meeting and told that the litigation would be discussed and it was
suggested that they not attend. (See Exhibits B and C). Mr. Marchand attended the Naples
meeting. At the meeting, Plaintiff's Complaint was read aloud and all fourteen Plaintiffs were
specifically named. Thereafter, HomeBane solicited loan officers to sign an affidavit confirming
their intention not to opt-into the instant case. The meeting was held in a public forum devoid of
confidentiality. HomeBanc has knowledge of loan officers who signed the affidavits and those
who did not. During the meeting HomeBanc stated that if a loan officer did not sign the affidavit
they will not be retaliated against. (See Exhibit B).

11. The conduct of HomeBanc is calculated to incite some members to feel that it is
being wrongfully sued and to send the message to all that Plaintiffs WILL be retaliated against,
while stating publicly that there will be no retaliation on the heels of firings, removal from
lucrative positions and resignations of loan officers.

ARGUMENT

I. ahis Court Has the Authority to Restrain or Limit Defendants' Ex-Parte
Communications with Putative Class Members

 

As in Rule 23 class actions, courts have the authority to govern the conduct of counsel
and parties in 0x00A7216(b) collective actions. See Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling, 493 US. 165,
171, 110 S. Ct. 482, 107 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1989). The court may restrict or limit ex-parte
communications with loan officers where, as in the instant case, the motion for collective action
has been filed but certification has not yet been decided. See Burrell v. Crown Central

Petroleum Inc., 176 F.R.D. 239 (E.D. Tex. 1997)(where alleged class action has been filed but

 

* Plaintiff is aware of the meetings held at the N. Broward office and the Naples office, however, like meetings may
have been held throughout the company.

certification has not yet been decided, court may issue limitation on ex-parte contact); see alse
Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurposes, Inc., 130 F. 3d 999 (11" Cir. 1997) 1" Circuit severely
restricted district court's authority to authorize pre-certification communication).

A court's authority to control counsel's conduct in a 0x00A7216(b) collective action includes
the authority to manage the process of joining multiple parties in a manner that is orderly,
sensible and not otherwise contrary to statutory commands or the provisions of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. See Hoffman-La Roche, 49 U.S. 165 at 171. Because of the potential for
abuses in collective actions, such as unapproved, misleading communications to absent class
members, "a district court has both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a
class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the conduct of counsel and parties." See
Gulf Oil Company v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 100,101 8. Ct. 2193, 68 L. Ed, 2d 693 (1981).

Courts have found a need to limit communications with absent class members where
communications were misleading, coercive, or an improper attempt to undermine Rule 23 by
encouraging class members not to join the suit. See Kleiner v. First Nat. Bank of Atlania, 751 F.
2d 1193, 1206 (11" Cir. 1985); Belt, 299 F. 2d at 667.

ii. HomeBanc''s Communication Is Coercive

HomeBanc is intimidating and coercing members in an attempt to prevent member
participation in the collective action. Communication from an employer has heightened potential
for coercion because where the absent class members and the defendant are involved in an
ongoing business relationship, such as employer-employee, any communications are more likely
to be coercive. See Kleiner, 751 F. 2d at 1202; Hampton Hardware Inc. v. Cotter & Company,
Inc., 136 F.R.D. 630 (N.D, Tex. 1994). HomeBanc exploited their relationship with members by

suggesting that participation in this action could affect the member's employment. First, loan

is "grounds for immediate termination." See Belt, 299 F. 2d at 668 (communication suggesting
that the lawsuit could affect the potential class members employment is coercive), This edict
also has the effect of preventing current Plaintiff's from explaining the nature of the cases to
putative Plaintiffs. Second, loan officers were told that the instant law suit could affect the price
of Home Bance's stock. See Shores v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 1996 WL 859985 WL (MLD.
Fla, Nov. 25, 1996), Shores, 1997 WL 714787 at *5 (Defendant's communication to potential
class members that an adverse result in the lawsuit could hurt the price of its stock and put
members' jobs at risk found to be coercive and intended to discourage class members from
participating in the litigation). Third, loan officers were told that plaintiffs still employed with
HomeBanc would be "performance managed out." This comment was confirmed by the public
removal of Mr. Mellman from the AmeriVest alliance office and the termination of Kevin
Finneran. The message is clear; if you participate in the instant lawsuit your employment status
will be affected.

The fact that HomeBanc stated that no retaliation would occur does not cure any coercive
effect of HomeBanc's actions, See Belt, 229 F.2d at 668 (assurances against retaliation do not
ameliorate fear of retaliation created by the communication's overall tone and the employer-
employee relationship).

lil. HomeBanc's Conduct Is An Attempt to Undermine The Purpose of the Collective
Action

HomeBanc is taking systematic action to intimidate and coerce putative class members in
an attempt to prevent member participation in the collective action. HomeBanc threatened loan

officer's job status should they decide to participate in the instant litigation and shortly thereafter

hefaAs neQeren QAOQA WARE thegcwManBatidivied OB AaING oPagmBehb4htent not to
opt-into the instant lawsuit. (See Exhibits A, B, and C).

HomeBanc's tactics are coercive in nature and are designed to undermine the purpose of
the collective action by pressuring members to sign an affidavit stating their intent not to opt-into
the instant lawsuit. [I]n-person solicitation may exert pressure and often demands an immediate
response. See Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447,456, 98 S. Ct. 1912,1918, 36 L,
ED.2d 444(1978). Unsupervised, unilateral communications with the plaintiff class
sabotage the goal of informed consent by urging exclusion on the basis of a one-sided
presentation of the facts, without opportunity for rebuttal, See Kleiner, 751 F.2d at 1202.
The damage could be irreparable. See Abdallah v. Coca-Cola Company, 186 F.R.D. 672 (ND.
Ga. 1999) citing Bower v. Bunker Hill Co., 689 F. Supp. 1032, 1033 (E.D. Wash. 1985). Under
such circumstances, "the absence of explicit proof or findings of harm or injury is immaterial."
See Ohralik at 468, 98 S. Ct. at 1924, and the trial court is empowered to enter prophylactic
orders designed to prevent harm before it happens". Id, at 458, 464-68, 98 S. Ct, at 1922-24.

It is clear that the point of HomeBance's actions was to solicit as many exclusions as
possible before this Court certified the collective action in an attempt to reduce HomeBance's
potential liability. See Hampton Hardware, 156 F.R.D. 630 at 633. (Communications improper
as an attempt to "reduce the class members [sic] participation in the lawsuit based on threats to
their pocketbooks"). In Hipp, the Eleventh Circuit specifically considered the standard for
permitting court-supervised collective actions. See Hipp 252 F.3d at 1218. The procedure

required by Hipp cannot be subject to circumvention. The Court reviews the pleadings and

 

* While the Ohralik analysis involved a subsequent as opposed to a prior restraint, however, the decision's approval
of prophylactic rules comports with the policy encouraging the effective oversight of commercial speech. See

Defendant is attempting to coerce affidavits from its loan officers through intimidation,
(oan officers fired and taken off accounts or resigned and Defendant stating that Plaintiffs would
be "performance managed out"), misinformation ("Plaintiffs are trying to take down the
company") and other improper means. It will likely file the solicited affidavits in an attempt to
block certification. Defendant is improperly attempting to short circuit the procedure set forth in
Hipp and prevent the matter from proceeding properly. Any such affidavits are hearsay and
would require deposition testimony and other discovery, such as the weekly sales activity reports
such as those provided by the Plaintiff. (See Exhibit E).

Furthermore, the tactics used by Defendants warrant sanctions, but now it is clear that the
matter is of an emergency nature. The Court should, in addition to restraining further conduct,
require Defendants to provide the names and addresses of all loan officers to whom it sent the
mailing so that the Plaintiff can hkewise do so. Additionally, the weekly sales activity reports of
all of the loan officers represented in this matter have exceeded forty hours and approximated 60
or more hours.

CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, HomeBanc's conduct meets the requisite standard for restriction
as an improper communication with absent class members. HomeBanc's communication is
coercive and an attempt to undermine the purpose of the collective action. Corrective action and
Sanctions are necessary to correct this misconduct.

communications with potential class members regarding the current action until the end of trial,
