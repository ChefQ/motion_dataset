PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

Procedural Posture of This Case

Plaintiff Bradford T. King, a Loan Officer employed at HomeBanc’s Naples/ Ft.
Myers store, initiated this dispute by filing a Complaint on behalf of himself and other
current and former Loan Officers alleging that he and the putative class members had
been misclassified as overtime-exempt employees under the FLSA. King was
subsequently joined by seven fellow loan officers who filed six similar lawsuits in this

Court,1 as well as five additional loan officers from the North Broward, Florida store who
filed in the Southern District of Florida.2
On May 4, 2006, Defendants filed a Motion to Consolidate the seven cases
pending in this Court,3 as well as a Motion to Consolidate the five Southern District cases
in that Court. 4 On the same day, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Consolidate all twelve cases
in this Court.5 Prior to any rulings on the Motions to Consolidate, Plaintiffs filed a
Motion to Conditionally Certify all of the cases as one collective action in this Court.6

B.

Facts Relevant to Plaintiffs’ Motion

The facts upon which Plaintiffs base their Motion are not “compelling,” as they
contend, except in the sense that they compellingly show HomeBanc has done nothing
improper. As an initial matter, a number of the Motion’s factual allegations are
unsupported by any signed affidavit, and therefore are devoid of any record support.
Second, many of the putative “facts” relied upon in the Motion are simply false, or taken
so far out of context as to be patently misleading. As indicated by the affidavit testimony
of HomeBanc’s employees (attached in the Appendix to this Response), the apparent
reason for Plaintiffs’ Motion is their frustration with the lack of interest among
HomeBanc loan officers in joining their lawsuits (“Lawsuits”).7
Contrary to Plaintiffs’ incomplete or misleading assertions, the real facts are as
follows:
•

Kevin Finneran’s employment was terminated by HomeBanc for job
abandonment on May 12, 2006 after Finneran failed to report to work
without notice for three weeks, failed to report for a standard, required,
quarterly performance review, and refused to respond to two certified
letters asking him to explain his absences (Affidavit of Bill Mei (“Mei
Aff.”) ¶¶ 8-9, attached hereto as Exhibit A);

•

Brad King’s vacation request was initially denied (but ultimately was
granted) despite (1) his having insufficient accrued vacation time to take
the trip, (2) his request for vacation being untimely under HomeBanc’s

7

As of the date of this filing, 13 of the 14 non-plaintiffs in HomeBanc’s Naples / Ft.
Myers store have signed affidavits that state they do not intend to opt-in to Plaintiffs’
Lawsuits even if they are certified. In HomeBanc’s North Broward store, 18 of the 37
non-plaintiffs have executed similar affidavits.

3

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 52

Filed 06/07/06 Page 4 of 17

policy; (3) his giving an incomplete and misleading explanation about the
reasons for taking vacation, given the fact that he used the time to play
catcher for the Long Island Ducks, a minor league baseball team (while
still employed by HomeBanc); and (4) his failing to return from his
“vacation” once it expired (Affidavit of Nigel Fullick (“Fullick Aff.”) ¶¶
16-18, attached hereto as Exhibit B);
•

Lucian Robinson voluntarily resigned his employment with HomeBanc on
May 18, 2006, but was immediately asked by Tom Flood if there was
anything HomeBanc could do to convince him to remain an employee
(Affidavit of Thomas Flood (“Flood Aff.”) ¶¶ 9-11, attached hereto as
Exhibit C);

•

Mark Mellman was relieved of his duties supporting AmeriVest, a
business partner of HomeBanc, after AmeriVest and Mellman’s coworkers (including Lucian Robinson, a co-plaintiff) criticized Mellman’s
performance, described his product and industry knowledge as “very
weak”, and expressed concern that he did not present a professional
appearance while working in AmeriVest’s offices (Fullick Aff. ¶¶ 11-12);

•

Thomas Flood conducted a routine, regularly scheduled business meeting
at HomeBanc’s Naples / Ft. Myers store during which he outlined his
goals for the Branch and, without referring to the Lawsuits, stated that
employees not performing to expectations would be closely managed
(Flood Aff. ¶ 6);

•

After Cary Marchand told Tom Flood that he was having second thoughts
about proceeding with his lawsuit against HomeBanc, Flood offered to
advance Cary Marchand funds in the event he was having financial
difficulties (Flood Aff. ¶14);

•

After a number of loan officers had expressed frustration with their
colleagues having filed the Lawsuits and when speculation about the
Lawsuits had become rampant, Nigel Fullick directed loan officers not to
discuss the Lawsuits and not to retaliate against those involved in the
Lawsuits (Fullick Aff. ¶¶ 5-7); and

•

In addition, at a regularly scheduled meeting at each store, HomeBanc
provided the following neutral and factual information concerning the
Lawsuits (read verbatim from a prepared statement):
¾

Lawsuits have been filed against HomeBanc by Brad King,
Mark Mellman, Cary Marchand, Robert Rodriguez, Amanda
Rudolph, John S. Rudolph, Michael Gottlieb, Lucian Robinson,

4

Filed 06/07/06 Page 5 of 17

Seta King, Tracy Tyler, Kevin Finneran, Emily Drews, Greg
Sepanski, and Aldana Gentinetta.
¾

The plaintiffs are current and former Loan Officers of
HomeBanc who are claiming they worked, on average, 60
hours per week and were required to perform "floor coverage"
at real estate agencies and builder service groups.

¾

The plaintiffs claim that they and all other Loan Officers at
HomeBanc have been misclassified as overtime-exempt
employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
(“FLSA”), and are therefore entitled to unpaid overtime for all
hours worked over forty in each week. The plaintiffs also seek
payment for their attorneys' fees in the lawsuits.

¾

The plaintiffs' attorneys have asked the Court to notify you
about the lawsuits so they can represent you and make similar
claims on your behalf.

¾

HomeBanc denies the allegations in the lawsuits and believes
that its compensation of Loan Officers is legal, fair, and
generous.

¾

If you do not want to participate in the lawsuits, we ask you to
sign an affidavit stating that.

¾

If you want to talk to an attorney or make any changes to the
affidavit before signing it, that is fine with us.

¾

Regardless of what you do (whether your sign the affidavit or
not or whether you join the lawsuits or not), HomeBanc will
not retaliate against you.

¾

For those interested in signing an affidavit, please see [a
HomeBanc Manager] after the meeting. (Affidavit of Gerry
Teeven (“Teeven Aff.”) ¶ 9, attached hereto as Exhibit D; Mei
Aff. ¶ 6).

In short, the facts show both that HomeBanc has continued to appropriately
manage its employees despite the Lawsuits and that several of the Plaintiffs have
performance issues and are, therefore, not similarly situated to the other Loan Officers.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY
A.

Plaintiffs Have not Met the Requirements for Obtaining a
Preliminary Injunction

In their Motion, Plaintiffs effectively seek to enjoin Defendants from
communicating with their own employees in a normal business setting. Although they
have not said so in their Motion, what they are really seeking is a preliminary injunction.
Plaintiffs have not, however, satisfied the well-established standard for obtaining this
“extraordinary and drastic remedy.”8 Accordingly, their Motion fails as a matter of law.
In order to obtain injunctive relief, a party must demonstrate that (1) there is a
substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered
unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever
damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the
injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.9 Injunctive relief should not be
granted unless the movant ‘“clearly carries the burden of persuasion’ as to the four
requisites.”10
Here, Plaintiffs have failed to carry this heavy burden. Indeed, their Motion is
devoid of any showing as to any of the four factors. This alone bars Plaintiffs’
entitlement to the relief they request.11

Defendants Have Not Acted Improperly

Instead of making the showing necessary to obtain the relief they request,
Plaintiffs’ Motion relies almost entirely on unsupported allegations of “egregious”
conduct by Defendants. As demonstrated below, however, Plaintiffs’ claim that
Defendants have acted improperly is based upon misrepresentations of both the facts and
the law. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not met even the burden of establishing that
Defendants’ conduct was improper and their Motion should be denied.
1.

Plaintiffs Have Misrepresented the Facts

As summarized in Section I.B. above and set forth fully in the Affidavits of Nigel
Fullick, Tom Flood, Gerry Teeven and Bill Mei, many of the alleged “retaliatory” acts
relied upon by Plaintiffs are nothing more than ordinary, business-related discussions and
decisions. For example, Plaintiffs characterize the termination of Kevin Finneran’s
employment as retaliatory (Pl.’s Motion at 5). The facts are that Finneran abandoned his
job, failed to come to work for over three weeks, failed to attend a mandatory (yet
ordinary and regularly scheduled) quarterly performance review, and failed to
communicate with HomeBanc regarding his unexcused absence (Mei Aff. ¶¶ 8-9).
Plaintiffs’ failure to mention and explain the actual reasons for Finneran’s departure is
telling -- by simply stating that Finneran was fired, Plaintiffs invite the Court to draw an
inference of retaliation based upon an incomplete recitation of the facts.

Wilson, M.J.) (denying motion to enjoin defendants in a Rule 23 class action from
contacting putative class members based on the plaintiffs’ failure to address the factors
necessary to obtain injunctive relief).

7

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 52

Filed 06/07/06 Page 8 of 17

Likewise, Plaintiffs attempt to impute a nefarious motive to HomeBanc from the
voluntary resignation of Lucian Robinson, another one of the Plaintiffs. Similar to
Finneran, Robinson’s signed affidavit does not state that he resigned because he believes
he was retaliated against; it is absolutely silent as to the reasons for his resignation.12 The
same is true of Plaintiff’s contention that Robinson was “offered future monetary
incentives to retract his resignation and conditioned the monetary incentives on Mr.
Robinson dismissing his lawsuit.” (Motion at 5, # 7). First, those allegations appear
nowhere in Robinson’s signed affidavit, and are therefore unsupported by the record.
Second, as set forth in Flood’s Affidavit, Flood’s sincere attempts to keep Robinson at
HomeBanc (a fact which in itself cuts against Plaintiffs’ assertion of retaliatory motive)
were not conditioned on Robinson’s withdrawing his lawsuit. (Flood Aff. ¶¶ 9-12).
Plaintiffs characterization of Mark Mellman’s removal from the AmeriVest RMA
is similarly misleading.13 As set forth in Nigel Fullick’s Affidavit, Mellman was
removed from that account for performance reasons and because the owner of AmeriVest
and Mellman’s fellow loan officers (including Plaintiff Robinson) had been critical of

12

Significantly, Plaintiffs attached an unsigned draft of Robinson’s affidavit to their
Motion that purported to state facts supporting a number of their claims. Robinson’s
signed affidavit subsequently filed by Plaintiffs is notably different from the draft, and is
devoid of any allegations regarding (1) the removal of Mark Mellman from the
AmeriVest account, (2) Tom Flood’s offering him “future monetary incentives”
conditioned on his dismissal of his lawsuit, and (3) certain statements purportedly made
by Fullick and/or Flood during business meetings.

13

Again, neither Mellman’s signed nor unsigned affidavit includes the facts set forth in
Plaintiffs’ Motion (See Pl.’s Motion, Ex. B). Plaintiffs’ representations could not be
more bereft of evidentiary support.

8

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 52

Filed 06/07/06 Page 9 of 17

Mellman’s performance (Fullick Aff. ¶¶ 11-12). Joe Ballarino, a principal of
AmeriVest, critiqued Mellman’s abilities as follows:
Mark is very strong in building relationships but not always based on a
business atmosphere. H[is] product and industry knowledge seems very
weak. Appearance is sometimes an issue, specifically neatness of
clothes[.] (Fullick Aff. ¶ 11, Ex. A).
Likewise, Mellman’s co-workers (especially co-Plaintiff Lucian Robinson) had been
critical of Mellman’s failure to report to work at AmeriVest when scheduled. (Fullick
Aff. ¶ 12, Ex. B).

Mellman’s removal from the AmeriVest account was, therefore, due

to legitimate, non-retaliatory business reasons that have not and cannot been disputed by
Plaintiffs.14
Finally, Plaintiffs take HomeBanc to task for alleged statements made to its
employees by Nigel Fullick, Tom Flood, and Gerry Teeven. First, Plaintiffs contend that
Flood said during a meeting that Plaintiffs would be “performance managed out” of the
company. That is false. Plaintiffs have twisted comments made by Flood during a
normal business meeting and inaccurately linked them to the Lawsuits. During the
meeting in question, Flood, who had recently assumed responsibility for the Naples / Ft.
Myers store, simply emphasized his business goals, and stated (without any reference to
the Lawsuits) that underperformers would be actively managed. This same message is
regularly communicated to employees in other stores every day. To restrain HomeBanc

14

As stated above, the majority of Plaintiffs’ allegations of retaliation against Mellman
rely upon a draft affidavit of Lucian Robinson that was never signed. As discussed
herein, Robinson’s signed affidavit omits the allegations of retaliatory conduct.

9

Case 2:06-cv-00096-UA-SPC Document 52

Filed 06/07/06 Page 10 of 17

from this sort of normal business discussion would be unwarranted and is patently
unreasonable.15
With respect to Fullick, a number of the statements attributed to him are false.
Fullick did not state that the Plaintiffs are “trying to take HomeBanc down” or the
Lawsuits could affect the price of HomeBanc stock. Fullick did emphasize to employees
HomeBanc’s policy against publicly discussing any lawsuit involving HomeBanc (not
just this one), and did instruct employees that they should not treat those involved in the
Lawsuits any differently from those who were not, even if they disapproved of the
Lawsuits. (Fullick Aff. ¶¶ 6-7). Fullick’s comments in context cannot be construed as
intimidating or retaliatory.
With misplaced hubris, Plaintiff’s also accuse Fullick of “initially den[ying]” a
request by Plaintiff Brad King for vacation purportedly because King is a Plaintiff. As
set forth in Fullick’s Affidavit, King’s vacation request was initially denied because it
was untimely and King had insufficient vacation time remaining. (Fullick Aff. ¶ 16).
The irony is that King gave Fullick an incomplete and misleading explanation for the
request. In addition to (1) driving his aunt “up north” (one purported reason for the
15

Plaintiff’s attempts to smear Flood as “offering future monetary incentives” for
Robinson and/or Cary Marchand to dismiss their lawsuits are also misleading. First of
all, there is nothing in Robinson’s signed affidavit supporting these allegations. As
discussed in Flood’s affidavit, he offered Robinson an advance against commissions not
to dismiss his lawsuit, but in an attempt to retain a valued employee at HomeBanc.
(Flood Aff. ¶¶ 11-12). With respect to Marchand, Flood offered him an advance against
commissions based upon Marchand’s representation that he wished to withdraw from the
lawsuit and Flood believed that Marchand might have financial difficulties related to
repayment of legal expenses. (Flood Aff. ¶ 14). Were Plaintiffs to obtain the relief they
request, once again, no good deed would go unpunished. Even if the statements
occurred as alleged, however, Flood was not prohibited from making what amounts to a
settlement offer to any Plaintiff.

vacation request), and (2) taking a family vacation (a second purported reason), it turns
out that King had signed a contract with the Long Island Ducks, a minor league baseball
team, and has been playing minor league baseball since at least April 20, 2006 -- while
still employed by HomeBanc.

(Fullick Aff. ¶ 18).

Finally, Plaintiffs’ Motion decries HomeBanc’s legitimate communication to its
employees regarding the Lawsuits. But those communications are factual, neutral, and
not the least bit retaliatory or intimidating. After a number of loan officers had expressed
anger and frustration with the Lawsuits, and with the “rumor mill” in high gear, managers
in HomeBanc’s Naples / Ft. Myers and North Broward stores each read from a prepared
script that simply described the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, the claims being made, and
stated that the Company opposed the plaintiffs’ claims. The verbatim statement set forth
in the attached affidavits belies Plaintiffs’ mischaracterization.
Nothing in the statements is improper, inaccurate, intimidating, or retaliatory.16
Plaintiffs’ characterization of those statements as improper is more a product of their
concern that their claims lack support among HomeBanc’s Loan Officers than of any
impropriety on the part of HomeBanc. In summary, Plaintiffs’ request for extraordinary,

16

Cary Marchand’s allegation that he was encouraged not to attend the meeting where
the Lawsuits were discussed is false. Rather, prior to the meeting, Gerry Teeven
(Assistant Branch Manager) contacted Mark Mellman and Cary Marchand to advise them
that the Lawsuits would be discussed at the meeting. Teeven did not want the two to be
surprised or made to feel uncomfortable when their claims were discussed. Teeven did
not tell either Mellman or Marchand that they were unwelcome at the meeting or suggest
that they not attend; he simply gave them the option not to attend. Both thanked Teeven
for the advance notice. Marchand ultimately attended the meeting, but Mellman did not.
(Teeven Aff. ¶ 8).

interim relief is “supported” by affidavits that were never signed and misrepresentations
of the actual events and statements.
2.

Plaintiffs Have Misrepresented the Law

More importantly, Plaintiffs have also misrepresented the law. Defendants are
legally entitled to communicate with their own employees, even with respect to the
Lawsuits. Plaintiffs’ contention to the contrary is based almost entirely on cases
involving post-certification Rule 23 class actions.17 But certified Rule 23 class actions
differ from FLSA collective actions brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) in significant
ways.
Once a Rule 23 class action is certified, absent class members are considered to
be part of the class and represented by class counsel unless and until they choose to “opt
out” of the class.18 Accordingly, defendants must “refrain from discussing the litigation
with members of the class as of the date of class certification.”19 On the other hand,
putative class members in an FLSA collective action do not become parties unless and
until they elect to “opt in” to the class.20 Until that time, putative class members are not

represented by the named Plaintiffs’ attorney so there is no attorney-client relationship
that must be protected.
Notably, Plaintiffs fail to cite the one case that appears to have directly addressed
this distinction in the context of communications with potential collective action class
members. In Parks v. Eastwood Insurance Services., Inc., 235 F. Supp. 2d 1082 (C.D.
Cal. 2002), an action to recover overtime wages under the FLSA, the court held that a
defendant employer may communicate with prospective plaintiff employees who have
not yet opted in to an FLSA collective action.21 There, the defendant employer had sent
its employees a memorandum regarding the lawsuit after the court had certified the class
and authorized court-supervised notice, but prior to the court’s notice being sent.22
Plaintiffs’ counsel then moved “to stop Defendant from communicating with prospective
Plaintiffs, and to make Defendant pay for a corrective notice.”23 The Court, noting the
distinction between certified classes under Rule 23 and FLSA collective actions under 29
U.S.C. § 216(b), denied plaintiffs’ motion.24 According to the court, “[t]he restrictions
on defendant communication with class action or representative action plaintiffs arise
from the existence of an attorney-client relationship.”25 Because there was no attorney-

client relationship at issue with respect to the members of the putative collective action
class, the defendant’s communications with them were proper.26
In the instant case, the circumstances weigh even more heavily in favor of
permitting communications. Whereas there was already a certified collective action class
in Parks at the time the communications occurred, the Court has yet to even conditionally
certify a class in this case. Moreover, the Parks court had already approved courtauthorized notice. Here, no notice has been approved. Therefore, Defendants’
communications with their employees could not have had the effect of undermining or
contradicting any court-approved notice. Finally, as stated above, Defendants’
discussions with their employees were not misleading or coercive.27 To the contrary,
Defendants specifically informed their employees of the Lawsuits and their right to join
them. Indeed, Defendants emphasized that they would not be retaliated against if they
decided to do so. In the event they did not wish to join, Defendants simply requested that
the employees voluntarily sign an affidavit memorializing that intent. Just as Plaintiffs
had every right to solicit affidavits and consents in order to show there was sufficient
26

Id.

27

The Parks court reasoned that communications with putative plaintiffs in FLSA
collective actions are more analogous to communications with potential members of Rule
23 class actions prior to certification. In pre-certification Rule 23 class actions,
communications are generally permitted, and any order prohibiting communications must
be supported by a “specific record by showing the moving party of the particular abuses
by which it is threatened” and must be “carefully drawn” so as to “limit[ ] speech as little
as possible.” Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 101-02 (1981). As stated above,
Plaintiffs’ allegations lack evidentiary support and are directly contradicted by the
affidavits of Bill Mei, Nigel Fullick, Tom Flood, and Gary Teeven. They have thus
failed to provide any “specific record…of [ ] particular abuses” justifying a restraint on
communications. See id. at 104 n.18 (“We agree with the Court of Appeals’ refusal to
give weight to Gulf’s unsworn allegations of misconduct…”).

demonstrating the opposite.28
