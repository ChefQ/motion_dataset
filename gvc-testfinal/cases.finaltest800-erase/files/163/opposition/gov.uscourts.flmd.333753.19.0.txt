_______________________________/
MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
Plaintiff, Dana Chapman, an individual (“Ms. Chapman”), on behalf of herself
and all others similarly situated, by and through her undersigned counsel, pursuant to
Rule 3.0, Local Rules of the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, files
this her Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
[DE 13], filed herein by Defendant, McCabe Law Group, P.A, a Florida professional
association (“McCabe Law” or “Collection Law Firm”):
I. INTRODUCTION
A. SYNOPSIS OF LITIGATION
1. Review of Complaint.
In the instant action, Ms. Chapman brought a claim against McCabe Law seeking
the recovery of statutory damages under 15 U.S.C. §1692, et sequi, known more
commonly as the “Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” (“FDCPA”), which prohibits debt
1

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 2 of 13 PageID 102

collectors from engaging in abusive, deceptive and unfair practices. In particular, Ms.
Chapman has alleged that McCabe Law failed to provide Ms. Chapman with a written
notice providing Ms. Chapman as a consumer with a so-called “validation notice”
mandated under 15 U.S.C. §1692g(a) [DE-1; Complaint ¶¶23-24]. According to the
allegations of the Complaint, on or about August 17, 2016, McCabe Law sent Ms.
Chapman written correspondence known more commonly in the collection industry as a
“dunning letter,” for the purpose of collecting monies for Association Fees purportedly
owed by Ms. Chapman to her condominium association, “Poinciana Villages
Association” (“Association”) (“8/17/16 Letter”) [DE 1; Complaint ¶8]. A copy of the
8/17/16 Letter is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit “A” and was set forth in its entirety
in the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by McCabe Law [Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings – p. 2].
The 8/17/16 Letter was entitled “Collection Notice.” Further, McCabe Law
advised Ms. Chapman that the Association “has authorized McCabe Law Group, P.A. for
collection efforts.” The 8/17/16 Letter also instructed Ms. Chapman to send payment of
the debt owed to the Association directly to McCabe Law. Lastly, the bottom of the
8/17/16 Letter provided a disclosure that the communication was from a “debt collector”
and that the McCabe Law intended to foreclose on a unspecified lien presumably on the
house of Ms. Chapman.
2. Overview of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
On March 21, 2017, McCabe Law filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses [DE
6]. With respect to the allegations by Ms. Chapman that McCabe Law was a debt
2

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 3 of 13 PageID 103

collector, McCabe Law answered that McCabe Law was “without knowledge” with
respect to whether McCabe Law was engaged in the collection of debts from consumers,
including Ms. Chapman [Answer to Complaint ¶¶5,6,7 and 22].
On April 18, 2017, McCabe Law filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
[DE 13]. The crux of the argument advanced by McCabe Law is that the 8/17/16 Letter
was not a “dunning letter” but rather an “informational letter” which was not subject to
the requirements of the FDCPA. As will be more fully argued below, the position of
McCabe Law that the 8/17/16 Letter was “informational” is without legal authority and
contradicts the plain language of the letter itself. Indeed, the argument of McCabe Law
that it was not acting as a “debt collector” in transmitting the 8/17/16 Letter is contrary to
the compelling force of reason.
B. SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF FDCPA
The FDCPA was enacted to protect consumers from and to eliminate “abusive
debt collection practices by debt collectors.” 15 U.S.C. §1692(e). The FDCPA also
protects law abiding debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection
practices from being competitively disadvantaged. Id. The FDCPA was enacted by
Congress after finding “abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive and unfair
debt collection practices by many debt collectors,” 15 U.S.C. §1692(a). Moreover,
Congress found that “[a]busive debt collection practices contribute to a number of
personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of
individual privacy.” Id.

3

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 4 of 13 PageID 104

The FDCPA enumerates general standards of proscribed conduct, defines and
restricts abusive collection acts as detailed in the Act, and provides for specific disclosure
rights for consumers. Such consumer rights include the requirement that debt collectors
provide a so-called “validation notice,” which discloses the amount of debt, the name of
the creditor, a statement that the validity of the debt will be assumed unless disputed by
the consumer within thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice, and an obligation to
verify the debt, including the disclosure of the name and address of the original creditor,
if the consumer so requests. 15 U.S.C. §1692g; see, Russell v. Equifax, 74 F.3d 30, 34 (2d
Cir. 1996); Bleich v. Revenue Maximization Group, 233 F.Supp.2d 496 (E.D. N.Y. 2002).
In addition to consumer disclosure rights, 15 U.S.C. §1693 provides for a broad
proscription against “[t]he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or
attempt to collect any debt or information concerning a consumer.” 15 U.S.C.
§1693e(10).
C. FDCPA AS A STRICT LIABILITY STATUTE
The FDCPA is a strict liability statute. As such, there are no unimportant or nonactionable violations. Bentley v. Great Lakes Collection Bureau, Inc., 6 F.3d 60, 63 (2d
Cir. 1993); Taylor v. Perrin, Landry, de Launay & Durand, 103 F.3d 1232 (5th Cir.
1997). Further, the FDCPA, as with all consumer statutes, is afforded broad and liberal
interpretation in favor of the consumer to effectuate its purposes. Cirkot v. Diversified
Financial Systems, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 941, 944 (D. Conn. 1993); cf., Rodash v. AIB
Mortgage Company, 16 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir. 1994) abrogated on other grounds by

4

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 5 of 13 PageID 105

Veale v. Citibank, F.S.B., 85 F.3d 577 (11th Cir. 1996); Schroder v. Suburban Coastal
Corporation, 729 F.2d 1371, 1380 (11th Cir. 1984).

D. APPLICATION OF THE “LEAST SOPHISTICATED
CONSUMER” STANDARD
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit established the
standard by which most violations of the FDCPA are analyzed, i.e., whether the
communication by the debt collector would mislead the “least sophisticated consumer.”
Jeter v. Credit Bureau, Inc., 760 F.2d 1168, 1172-75 (11th Cir. 1985). Under the
governing standard, a court need not determine whether the named plaintiff or other
putative plaintiffs were misled or were confused by the notice, as the standard is whether
the ‘least sophisticated consumer’ would have been misled. Swanson v. Mid Am, Inc., 186
F.R.D. 665, 667 (M.D. Fla. 1999). The basic purpose of the least sophisticated consumer
standard is to ensure that the FDCPA protects all consumers, “the gullible as well as the
shrewd.” Clomon v. Jackson, 988 F.2d 1314, 1318 (2d Cir. 1993). The actions of D&S
as alleged in the Complaint herein must be evaluated from the standpoint of the least
sophisticated consumer.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
“Judgment on the pleadings is appropriate where there are no material facts in
dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. In
determining whether a party is entitled to judgment on the pleadings, the Court is
required to accept as true all material facts alleged in the non-party’s pleading, and the
Court must view those facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. See,
5

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 6 of 13 PageID 106

Hawthorne v. Mac Adjustment, Inc., 140 F.3d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1998). If the
comparison of the averments in the competing pleadings reveal a material dispute of the
fact, judgment on the pleadings must be denied. See, Stanton v. Larsh, 239 F.2d 104, 106
(5th Cir. 1956); see also, Perez v. Wells Fargo, N.A., 774 F.3d 1329 (11th Circ. 2014).
III. LEGAL AUTHORITY
A. ON ITS FACE, THE 8/17/16 LETTER FROM McCABE LAW TO PLAINTIFF
CONSTITUTES A “COMMUNICATION” IN THE FURTHERANCE
OF THE COLLECTION OF A DEBT AND THEREFORE IS
SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FDCPA
In its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, McCabe Law correctly states the
FDCPA does not apply to every communication between the debt collector and debtor.
“[F]or a communication to be in connection with the collection of a debt, an animating
purpose of the communication must be to induce payment by the debtor.” Parker v.
Midland Credit Management, Inc., 874 F.Supp.2d 1353, 1357 (M.D. Fla. 2012), quoting
Grden v. Leikin, Ingber & Winters, P.C., 643 F.3d 169, 173 (6th Cir. 2011). As stated by
Judge Moody of this District, “obviously communications that expressly demand
payment will almost certainly have this purpose.” Id. quoting Grden, 643 F.3d at 173.
Further, an “implicit demand for payment may exist where the letter states the amount of
the debt, describes how the debt may be paid, provides the phone number and address to
send payment, and expressly states that the letter is for the purpose of collecting a debt.”
Leahy-Fernandez v. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, 159 F.Supp.3d 1294, 1303 (M.D. Fla.
2016), quoting Pinson v. Albertelli Law Partners, LLC, 618 Fed. Appx. 551, 553 (11th
Cir.2015). “On the opposite end of the spectrum, where communication is ‘merely
informational’ and explicitly informs the debtor that the communication or notice is not
6

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 7 of 13 PageID 107

an attempt to collect a debt or a demand for payment, courts have held that these
communications are not subject to the FDCPA.” Prindle v. Carrington Mort. Servs., LLC,
2016 WL 4369424, at *6 (M.D. Fla. August 16, 2016) (citing Hasbun v. Recontrust Co.,
508 Fed. Appx. 941, 942 (11th Cir. 2013); Hernandez v. Dyck-O’Neal, Inc., 215 WL
2094263 at*3 (M.D. Fla. May 5, 2015); Parker, 874 F.Supp.2d at 1358; Sellers v.
Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC, 2017 WL 1683613 (M.D. Fla. May 3,
2017).
In Sellers, a borrower who had received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge
received collection communications from a mortgage loan servicer which had acquired
the mortgage after the bankruptcy discharge. Unlike the collection letter in the instant
case, the mortgage servicer informed the borrower that the statement was “not an attempt
to collect a debt.” Id. at *2-3. After receiving the various communications from the loan
servicer, the homeowner filed a class action asserting inter alia that the communication
from the mortgage servicer violated the FDCPA with respect to the servicer’s attempt to
collect a debt which it had no legal right to collect as a result of the bankruptcy discharge
Id. at *3.
In its motion for summary judgment, the mortgage servicer argued the various
communications after the bankruptcy discharge were “for informational purposes” and
thus were not actionable under the FDCPA. In denying summary judgment, Judge
Corrigan of this Court held:
As the Eleventh Circuit has not identified a specific test for determining
whether a particular communication is made in connection with the
collection of a debt such that it falls within the ambit of the FDCPA, many
courts in this Circuit look to out-of-circuit decisions for guidance. See,
7

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 8 of 13 PageID 108

Prindle, 2016 WL 4369424, at *6 (citing Parker, 874 F. Supp. 2d at
1356). For instance, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have identified “the
relationship of the parties, the intent of the communication, as well as
whether there was a demand for payment as factors to consider when
determining whether a communication falls within the scope of the
FDCPA.” Parker, 874 F. Supp. 2d at 1356-57. “Other factors courts have
considered include whether the communication was sent in response to an
inquiry or request by the debtor; whether it was from a debt collector;
whether it stated that it was an attempt to collect a debt; and whether the
communication threatened consequences if the debtor failed to pay.”
Prindle, 2016 WL 4369424, at *6 (citing Bohringer v. Bayview Loan
Servicing, 141 F. Supp. 3d 1229, 1240-41 (S. D. Fla. 2015).
Id. at *6
In denying the motion for summary judgment, the Court in Sellers recognized that
in terms of the relationship of the servicer to the borrower, it was clear that the servicer
was “indisputably a debt collector.” Id.. Further, as the mortgage statements contained
instructions for payment, the Court found that a reasonable jury could find it to be a
communication made in connection with the collection of a debt. Id. at *7-8.
In the instant case, unlike Sellers, there is not a factual issue that the 8/17/16
Letter from McCabe Law is a collection letter. To begin with, the letter has in boldface
print and at dead center the words: “Collection Notice.” The 8/17/16 Letter also states
the “Association of Poinciana Villages, Inc.” (the ‘Association’) has authorized McCabe
Law Group, P.A. (sic) for collection efforts.” The letter instructs the recipient to send
payment directly to McCabe Law. Lastly, McCabe Law even acknowledged it was a
debt collector in its incomplete and defective disclosure of the so-called FDCPA
validation rights at the bottom of the letter.
A consumer receiving the 8/17/16 Letter would not view the letter as being merely
informational but rather an effort on the part of McCabe Law to induce payment. This
8

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 9 of 13 PageID 109

position is especially compelling as a letter from an attorney such a McCabe Law implies
that the debt will be placed into litigation. This is much different from the
“informational” notices like periodic account statements and debt transfer notices
referenced by McCabe Law in its Motion.
From the standpoint of the least sophisticated consumer, the 8/17/16 Letter was for
the purpose of collecting unpaid association fees.

B. PURSUANT TO ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AUTHORITY, THE DISCLOSURE BY
McCABE LAW THAT McCABE LAW INTENDED TO FORECLOSE ON THE
CHAPMAN RESIDENCE SUBJECTS McCABE LAW TO ALL REQUIREMENTS
OF THE FDCPA, INCLUDING PROVIDING A DISCLOSURE OF THE “AMOUNT
OF DEBT” MANDATED BY 15 U.S.C. §1692g(a)(1)
In its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, McCabe Law goes to great lengths
to present the 8/17/16 Letter as being “informational” and not for the purpose of
collecting a debt from Ms. Chapman. Indeed, McCabe Law went so far as to state:
MCCABE did not take other action that could be interpreted as trying to
induce payment of the debt, like threatening additional penalties or fees,
hounding the Plaintiff for payment, proposing alternatives to immediate or
full payment, or even just telling Plaintiff the amount she needed to pay.
[Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings – p. 11].
Contrary to the assertion by McCabe Law, McCabe Law also informed Ms.
Chapman of the serious consequences facing Ms. Chapman if she failed to pay:
The firm is solely advising of the intent to foreclosure on behalf of the
Association pursuant to said lien on such a property, and a personal money
judgment will not be sought against you.
[Complaint – Exhibit “A”].

9

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 10 of 13 PageID 110

From the perceptive of the least sophisticated consumer, the 8/17/16 Letter was
for inducing payment of the debt under the threat that McCabe Law would foreclose on
Ms. Chapman’s residence.
In the seminal decision of Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterree & Adams, LLP, 678
F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 2012), the Eleventh Circuit held that a foreclosure law firm was a
“debt collector” under the FDCPA when it demanded payment of the balance of the note
secured by a “security deed” and repeatedly stated that it was a debt collector. The Court
initiated its analysis by recognizing the difference between a promissory note and
security interest. Id. at 1216.
On the distinction, the Court stated:
A promissory note is a contract evidencing a debt and specifying terms
under which one party will pay money to another. See Black’s Law
Dictionary 1089 (8th Ed. 2004) (defining “promissory note” as an
“unconditional” written promise, signed by the maker, to pay absolutely
and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the
bearer or a designated person”); see also Ga. Code. Ann. § 11-9102(a)(64) (“Promissory note” means an instrument that evidences a
promise to pay a monetary obligation ....”). By contrast, a security interest
is not a promise to pay a debt; it is an interest in some collateral that a
lender can take if a debtor does not fulfill a payment obligation. See
Black’s Law Dictionary 1384 (8th ed. 2004) (defining a “security” as
“[c]ollateral given or pledged to guarantee the fulfillment of an
obligation”). A mortgage is a type of security interest with real property as
the collateral. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1031 (8th ed. 2004); see also
Ga.Code Ann. §44-14-30 (“A mortgage in this state is only security for a
debt and passes no title.”).
Id. at 1216.
The Court recognized that whether the obligation of the homeowner to pay off a
promissory note was a “debt” does not end the inquiry. Rather, as the Court framed it, the
pertinent question “was whether the Ellis law firm’s letter and enclosed documents are an
10

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 11 of 13 PageID 111

attempt to ‘collect’ a debt within the meaning of the FDCPA.” Id. at 1217. In reviewing
the communication by the Ellis law firm, the Court took note of the fact that the Ellis law
firm had demanded “full immediate payment of all amounts due.” Similar to McCabe
Law in the instant case, the Ellis law firm also provided the statutorily mandated
disclosures under 15 U.S.C. §1692e(11) when it stated inter alia: “THIS LAW FIRM IS
ACTING AS A DEBT COLLECTOR AND ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT A DEBT.”
Id.
In an attempt to avoid liability under the FDCPA, the Ellis law firm argued in part
that the subject communications were not debt collection activity because the Ellis law
firm intended merely to inform the property owner that the Ellis law firm- like McCabe
Law here- intended to foreclose a security deed in a non-judicial foreclosure. Id. The
Eleventh Circuit cast the argument of the Ellis law firm as follows:
In other words, we should ignore the language in the letter and documents
that demands payment on the promissory note in favor of what the firm
says was the purpose (of the firm or of the letter and documents it sent, or
both). If we will do that, the firm argues, we will see that the letter and
documents were not an attempt to collect a debt within the meaning of
§1692e but merely an attempt to enforce a security interest.
Id.
The Eleventh Circuit rejected the Ellis law firm’s position because it “wrongly
assumes that a communication cannot have dual purposes.” Id. In its holding, the Court
stated in a pointed manner:
The rule the Ellis law firm asks us to adopt would exempt from the
provisions of §1692e any communication that attempts to enforce a
security interest regardless of whether it also attempts to collect the
underlying debt. That rule would create a loophole in the FDCPA. A
big one. In every case involving a secured debt, the proposed rule would
11

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 12 of 13 PageID 112

allow the party demanding payment on the underlying debt to dodge the
dictates of §1692e by giving notice of foreclosure on the secured interest.
The practical result would be that the Act would apply only to efforts to
collect unsecured debts. So long as a debt was secured, a lender (or its law
firm) could harass or mislead a debtor without violating the FDCPA. That
can’t be right. It isn’t.
Id. at 1217 – 1218
(emphasis added by Plaintiff).
As reflected above, the Eleventh Circuit emphatically recognized that a collection
law firm such as McCabe Law could evade all requirements of the FDCPA by simply
omitting the validation notice under 15 U.S.C. §1692g through an argument that a
mortgage or other lien secured the underlying debt. In the instant case, it is clear that the
8/17/16 Letter had the principal purpose of compelling Ms. Chapman to pay the debt
purported owed to the Association.
McCabe Law attempts to use the proverbial “loophole” that the Eleventh Circuit
was concerned about in the Reese opinion. McCabe Law would go even further, as it
incredulously argues that because it did not state the “amount of debt”- which is the
violation the basis of the instant lawsuit – that is somehow exempted from the FDCPA.
(Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings- p. 11). Ms. Chapman speculates that the reason
the “amount of debt” was not included in the letter in the first place is because either
McCabe Law did not want to spend the time or did not have the ability to confirm the
“amount of debt” with Association at the time of the transmittal of the letter. See, Miller
v. McCalla, Raymer, Padrick, Cobb, Nichols and Clark, LLC, 214 F. 3rd 872 (7th Cir.
2000) [full current amount of debt must be disclosed as part of the verification process].
In short, the position of McCabe Law is reasonably calculated to erode the consumer
12

Case 3:17-cv-00193-HLA-JBT Document 19 Filed 05/15/17 Page 13 of 13 PageID 113

protections created by Congress in enacting the FDCPA and cannot be condoned by this
Court.

IV. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Dana Chapman, an individual, on behalf of herself and
all others similarly situated, respectfully requests this Court deny the Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings and direct such other and further relief as justice may require.
