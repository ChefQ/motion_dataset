SURREPLY IN OPPOSITION TO
FOREST RIVER'S MOTION TO COMPEL DOCUMENT PRODUCTION

In the Joint Response to Forest River's Motion to Compel Document Production (the
"Response"), Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC ("Heartland") noted that it was in the
process of searching for a bill related to a professional prior art search with respect to U.S. Patent
No. 7,278,650 (the "'650 patent"), one that Forest River believes must exist. In the Response,
Heartland stated the following:

That said, Heartland is currently in the process of searching its
financial records for the relevant time period to see if it can locate
any bill related to a professional prior art search with respect to the
'650 patent. Heartland has completed its search for the relevant
time periods in 2005. That search did not yield a bill for a
professional prior art search related to the prosecution of the '650
patent. Heartland's financial records from 2004 are not loaded into
its accounting software. Hence, a search of those records will have
to be done manually. Heartland is currently in the process of
conducting a reasonable, manual search through its financial
records for the year 2004. If that exploration yields a bill for a
professional prior art search related to the prosecution of the '650
patent, Heartland will immediately produce that bill to Forest
River. However, if, as expected, Heartland is unable to find such a
bill, then an order to compel production of such a bill would be
futile, for Heartland would have nothing to produce.

case 3:08-cv-00490-TLS-CAN document 104 filed 03/16/10 page 2 of3

(DE 93, p. 6.)

Since filing the Response, Heartland's Chief Financial Officer has searched its 2004

billing records and sorted through the file folders associated with each Heartland supplier.

Heartland's Chief Financial Officer did not locate a bill for research services related to the

prosecution of the '650 patent. Thus, even if the Court were to order Heartland to produce all

billing records related to a professional prior art search in connection with the '650 patent,

Heartland would have nothing to produce.
