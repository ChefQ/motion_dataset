Case No.: 05-27-SLR

Jury Trial Demanded

MOTION BY TATUNG COMPANY, TATUNG COMPANY OF AMERICA, INC., AND
JEAN COMPANY TO JOIN IN THE MOTION TO STAY THE CASE PENDING
RESOLUTION AGAINST THE LCD MODULE MANUFACTURERS

RLF] -2888023-]
Case 1:05-cv-00027-SLR Document114 ~~ Filed 06/14/2005 Page2of5

Defendants Tatung Company ("Tatung"), Tatung Company of America, Inc ("Tatung
America'), and Jean Company hereby incorporate and join in Dell's motion to stay the litigation
against the customer defendants. Specifically Tatung, Tatung America, and Jean request that the
case be stayed against them pending resolution of the case against the LCD module
manufacturers

A stay in this case is warranted because Tatung, Tatung America, and Jean do not design
or manufacture any LCD modules Instead, they are simply customers of such modules, and they
possess virtually no knowledge regarding the design or components of the LCD panels in the
accused products. It will greatly simplify this case and promote judicial economy if this case
proceeds only against the LCD module manufacturers. Because each of the LCD modules or
products containing LCD modules that are purchased or sold by Tatung, Tatung America, and
Jean are manufactured by one of the defendants named in this litigation, Guardian will not be
prejudiced by any such stay

The grounds for this motion are set for the in the accompanying Opening Brief by Tatung

Company, Tatung Company of America, Inc., and Jean Company to Join in the Motion to Stay

the Case Pending Resolution Against the LCD Module U by eM S ft U ZS |
