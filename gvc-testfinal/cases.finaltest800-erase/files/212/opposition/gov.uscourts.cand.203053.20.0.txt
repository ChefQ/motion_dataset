ISSUES TO BE PRESENTED

4 Falsity
5

1.

Whether the Complaint’s alleged false material statements are pled with sufficient

6 particularity because the Complaint sets forth: (a) Defendants’ false statements made directly to the
7

market and to securities analysts who repeated them to the market; and (b) the reasons why those

8
statements were false, because these allegations are bolstered by 15 confidential witnesses who
9
10
11
12
13

corroborated each other and were in positions to know the information attributed to them.
Safe Harbor
2.

Whether the alleged false statements of historical fact are actionable because they are

more than mere statements of optimism and whether the statements are not insulated from liability

14
15
16

under the PSLRA’s safe harbor provisions because they are not forward-looking and, even if
considered forward-looking, they were made with actual knowledge or not accompanied by

17 meaningful cautionary language.
18
19
20
21

Scienter
3.

Whether the Complaint satisfies the PSLRA’s scienter standard by: (a) pleading

Defendants’ actual knowledge of their false statements; and (b) whether sufficient facts regarding

22 Defendants’ hands-on control of Yahoo!’s core business, SOX certifications and massive insider
23 selling allow the Court to draw an inference of scienter.
24
25
26

Loss Causation
4.

Whether the Complaint sets forth “some indication of the loss and the causal

27 connection that the Plaintiff has in mind” by demonstrating that the January and July 2006 declines
28 in Yahoo!’s stock price were directly tied to Defendants’ false statements regarding Yahoo!’s efforts

to upgrade its search business and false financial results bolstered by improperly recognized click
fraud revenue.
Insider Trading Claim
5.

Whether the Complaint states a claim for unlawful contemporaneous trading because

Plaintiffs plead a primary violation of the securities laws and Defendants were in possession of
material, non-public information when they made contemporaneous stock sales.
Control-Person Claim
6.

Whether the Complaint states a claim for control-person liability against Defendants

because Plaintiffs plead a primary violation of the securities laws and set forth particularized facts
demonstrating that the Individual Defendants ran the day-to-day operations of Yahoo!, influenced
and controlled the decision-making at Yahoo! and the contents and release of the alleged false
statements.

INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Amended Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities Laws

3 (“Complaint”) easily meets this Circuit’s pleading requirements. The Complaint pleads specifics,
4 from 15 confidential witnesses (“CWs”), detailing why Defendants’ public statements were false by
5 identifying the material adverse facts that were concealed from investors. The crucial failure of
6 Yahoo! to develop a search engine business to compete with Google was withheld from investors.
7 Investors were also unaware Yahoo! was improperly recognizing revenue from click fraud from its
8 affiliates and partners to the detriment of its advertising customers, which allowed Yahoo! to meet
9 earnings estimates and inflate Yahoo!’s stock price.
Defendants’ assertions that Plaintiffs have not adequately pled falsity are wrong.

10

11 Defendants’ statements of historical fact that Yahoo! had successfully integrated Overture, that the
12 Company was successfully developing an upgrade to Overture and that the Company’s search
13 business was allowing it to achieve record results were false and misleading when made. The
14 Complaint contains particularized allegations setting forth why Defendants’ statements were false
15 and were not merely optimistic forward-looking statements about future prospects or search business
16 upgrades, that are supported by credible CWs, including former employees who were in a position to
17 know why Yahoo!’s acquisition of Overture and Project Panama’s (“Panama”) development were
18 failures.
19

Contrary to Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs’ false revenue recognition claims are

20 conclusory and not supported by adequate particularity as to the amount of revenue improperly
21 recognized, the Complaint sets forth an adequate basis that the amount of the improper revenue
22 recognized by click fraud was at least 10% of Yahoo!’s quarterly revenues by pointing to
23 independent experts and ex-Yahoo! employees who observed the practice. ¶¶204-208.1 Yahoo! has
24 also agreed in a settlement with its advertising customers to refund click fraud generated revenue
25 recognized during the Class Period, although it continues to conceal the amount. ¶¶10, 147.

Page 10 of 37

The Complaint also sets forth a strong inference of Defendants’ scienter based on facts from

2 15 CWs, who are all former employees of Yahoo!, demonstrating Defendants’ actual knowledge of
3 the Overture integration and Panama development problems and the way Yahoo! benefited from
4 click fraud revenues to meet quarterly earnings numbers. ¶¶20-34, 155-178. The CWs are
5 corroborated by cogent inferences drawn from Defendants’ executive positions and involvement in
6 the Company’s core operations. Defendants were not only at the center of the Overture integration,
7 development of Panama and closely monitored the Company’s systems used to detect and
8 supposedly prevent click fraud, but Defendants held themselves out to the market as extremely
9 hands-on managers familiar with Yahoo!’s business and even signed SOX certificates stating the
10 Company’s internal controls were effective. This Court should reject Defendants’ effort to ignore an
11 astounding $879 million in stock sales, constituting a significant percentage of their holdings – 84%
12 to 90% excluding vested options, and 35.6% to 68.1% including vested options – and an amount
13 670% larger than the same period prior to the Class Period. ¶12. In sum, Plaintiffs’ inferences of
14 scienter are at least as compelling as Defendants’ non-culpable explanations. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor
15 Issues & Rights, Ltd., __ U.S. __, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2509 (2007).
16

Defendants’ arguments regarding loss causation also fail because the Complaint provides

17 Defendants with far more than the required “indication of the loss and the causal connection that the
18 plaintiff has in mind.” Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005). Here, the partial
19 disclosure and Class Period ending announcement all tie directly to the Defendants’ fraudulent
20 statements regarding Yahoo!’s search business and improper recognition of revenue via click fraud.
21 ¶¶125, 126, 130, 150. Yahoo!’s stock price declined significantly in January 2006 and again in July
22 2006 when Yahoo! disclosed its true business conditions and was forced to downsize future earnings
23 targets. As such, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the requirements from Dura by explaining how their loss
24 was suffered when the market became aware that Panama was delayed and the Company’s search
25 revenue was declining because it was forced to terminate relationships with lower quality affiliates
26 who were contributing to click fraud at Yahoo!. ¶150. With these allegations, Plaintiffs have
27 exceeded what the Ninth Circuit found sufficient in In re Daou Sys., 411 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2005).

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2

Plaintiffs bring this securities fraud class action on behalf of investors who acquired Yahoo!

3 securities from April 8, 2004 to July 18, 2006 (the “Class Period”), against Yahoo! and the
4 Individual Defendants.2 The detailed allegations in the Complaint show that by 2003 Yahoo! was
5 desperate to end its dependence on Google’s algorithm for its search business, which accounted for
6 40% of its revenues. ¶¶3, 42. Although Google was dominating this expanding, lucrative industry,
7 in 2003 Yahoo! acquired Overture, an internet search company, to catch up to Google and develop
8 its own search algorithm. Id. The Overture acquisition was a disaster. Overture’s internet platform,
9 accounting for over 50% of Yahoo!’s revenue and critical to the expansion of its search marketing
10 business, was incapable of handling the internet traffic pulsing through it and was “‘bursting at the
11 seams’” and “literally self destructing.” ¶30. In spite of the major obstacles to Yahoo!’s
12 development of a new search technology, the Company ignored repeated requests from personnel to
13 provide additional funding for servers in Overture’s Pasadena facility. ¶¶29, 30, 56(a). Yahoo! also
14 fired senior Overture engineers most knowledgeable about and capable of developing the new search
15 technology. ¶3, 29, 56(b).
16

With knowledge of these crippling problems, in an effort to maintain the facade of keeping

17 up with Google, Defendants told investors the Overture acquisition was a success when exactly the
18 opposite was true. In Yahoo!’s 2003 Annual Report, CEO Semel stated: “The integration of the
19 Yahoo! and Overture . . . has proceeded well, and . . . seems even more compelling than we initially
20 thought.” ¶45. In releasing Yahoo!’s 1Q 04 financial results, the Company reported: “‘On the
21 technology front we hit the ball out of the park.’” ¶56. Given the problems permeating Overture
22 since its acquisition, these statements were false and misleading. The failure to successfully
23 integrate Overture had longstanding and detrimental consequences on Yahoo!’s execution of an
24 improved search marketing technology. In an effort to revamp the Overture system and better

2
The Individual Defendants include Terry S. Semel, Yahoo! CEO and Chairman of the Board of
26 Directors;
Daniel L. Rosensweig, Yahoo! COO; Farzad Nazem, Yahoo! Executive Vice President
and
CTO;
and Susan L. Decker, Yahoo! CFO and Executive Vice President of Finance and
27 Administration
(“Individual Defendants,” and with Yahoo! “Defendants”). ¶¶13-18.

1 “monetize” its search business, in 2004 Yahoo! embarked on “Project Panama.” ¶3. Panama was
2 also a nightmare for the Company. Panama’s leadership changed three times in 2004 and 2005. ¶3,
3 32. The integration of separate software systems, a necessary precursor to Panama and known
4 internally as “‘solving the blob,’” was far behind schedule due to Yahoo!’s firing of Overture
5 engineers. ¶¶3, 29, 102(c), 163. The user interface and algorithm were delayed and incomplete.
6 ¶¶30, 139(a). An essential integration of back-end components known as “Cheetah” was delayed
7 due to the problems at Overture. ¶23. Panama as a whole was “‘stalled, delayed, and derailed’”
8 because Yahoo! fired Overture’s technical experts. ¶31(d).
9

Each Individual Defendant was aware of these dilemmas impeding the execution of Panama.

10 Panama was run out of Nazem’s office after October 2005 when it was transferred to Sunnyvale, and
11 Nazem was briefed on a weekly basis by the lead project manager of Panama. ¶¶20, 23. In turn,
12 Nazem shared the truth regarding Panama’s delayed and uncertain status with the other Individual
13 Defendants in weekly meetings. ¶¶20(a), 160. Semel was also briefed on Panama’s dire situation on
14 a weekly basis by the project’s leadership team. ¶¶32, 94.
15

Despite the problems with Panama, Defendants assured investors the implementation of

16 Yahoo!’s improved search marketing technology was moving ahead in a successful and timely
17 manner. See, e.g., ¶¶103, 104. Defendants’ statements were false and misleading, as the Individual
18 Defendants knew yet failed to disclose that Panama was far behind schedule, with no tangible date
19 for release confirmed. ¶¶20(a), 160. On October 18, 2005, CFO Decker informed investors that
20 Panama would be complete in late 2005, with financial benefits growing through 2006. ¶117.
21 Analysts repeated this information, emphasizing Panama as a “key driver” of the Company’s
22 earnings in late 2005 and throughout 2006. ¶120.
23 The Truth Begins to Emerge
24

One quarter later, Defendants announced during a January 18, 2006 conference call that there

25 would be a delay in Panama’s implementation to the second half of 2006. ¶125. Defendants also
26 made a partial disclosure that day in its 4Q05 results, missing estimates and issuing guidance lower
27 than expected by investors for FY 2006. ¶6, 126, 130. Yahoo! blamed slower search growth and an
28 anticipated increase in rates paid to affiliate websites. ¶6. The Company was being pressured to

1 drop lower quality affiliates that were being utilized for click fraud, which benefited Yahoo!, and
2 therefore would have to share more advertising revenue with higher quality affiliates. ¶¶6, 126, 130.
3 The Company’s stock price decreased over 10% on 118 million shares traded – five times Yahoo!’s
4 normal trading volume. ¶¶126, 130. Defendants did not admit, however, the full truth – that click
5 fraud revenues obtained from these affiliate websites were becoming harder to justify given the
6 recent advertiser backlash and increased media scrutiny of click fraud. ¶127.
7

Because Yahoo! failed to successfully integrate Overture and implement Panama, in 2004

8 and 2005, the Company’s paid search revenues stagnated. ¶56(f). Desperate to demonstrate

10 recognition of search revenue they had not earned. ¶¶4-5, 22, 25, 29, 31, 56(e).3 Purposefully
11 exploiting the problem of click fraud, Yahoo! decided in late 2004 to “relax” the business rules and
12 filters in the click fraud detection system, particularly at quarter-end, allowing Yahoo! to generate
13 additional revenue by permitting the counting of improper clicks on content match partner sites.
14 ¶¶5, 22(d), 27, 31(k). Further, refunds for non-billable clicks were delayed until after quarter end.

10
demonstrating Defendants’ knowledge of their fraud (¶¶155-178, 179-197); the financial motives for

Defendants’ fraud, including their massive insider trading (¶¶179-197); Yahoo!’s false financial
12

In this Circuit, the

2 concealment of business problems is actionable fraud.9 Defendants were desperate to compete with
3 Google for market share in the fast growing, multi-billion dollar search business, and rushed to
4 create Yahoo!’s own search technology, which resulted in chaos and insurmountable engineering
5 problems that negatively impacted Yahoo!’s advertising revenue growth. After the acquisition of
6 Overture, Defendants misled investors by representing the integration was successful and Yahoo!
7 was positioned for revenue growth with its new search platforms.10 These statements were false and
8 misleading because Defendants knew that their new search platform was an engineering disaster,
9 “‘bursting at the seams’” and “literally self destructing.” ¶¶30, 56, 60, 73, 79, 90, 102, 113.
10 However, Defendants continued to mislead investors about the Company’s record revenue growth
11 resulting from the new search platform, knowing that the engineering problems were stagnating
12 revenues.11
13

Defendants also argue that these statements are non-actionable “expressions of enthusiasm,

14 dedication, and optimism.” Defs.’ Mem. at 10-12. The Complaint concerns Defendants’ false
15 statements regarding Yahoo!’s current business condition. Advertising revenue growth and the

18 have set forth with particularity each of Defendants’ false statements and specifically why each
statement was false. In Metzler, the Ninth Circuit held plaintiff’s falsity allegations were inadequate
19 because in a blanket fashion, plaintiff claimed each statement made during the class period related to

20 adequately articulate why each statement was false. Id. at *50-*51.

1 Company’s successful search business, including the integration of Overture and operation of the
2 new platform, were critical aspects of Yahoo!’s business and closely watched by analysts and

In fact, it was Yahoo!’s switch to its own search technology via Overture, and its revenue

9 growth, that were critical to convincing the market that the Company had a shot at competing with
10 Google. At the time Defendants were making these false statements, they knew that the integration
11 of Overture was a failure, the Company’s transition to a new search platform (so it could compete
12 with Google) was an engineering disaster and revenues stagnated as a result. Clearly, investors
13 would consider statements regarding the most critical aspect of Yahoo!’s business to be important

3 Defendants’ disclosure in July 2006 that Panama would again be delayed, this time beyond 4Q06.
4 ¶¶8, 150. Investors punished Yahoo!’s stock, sending it down over 22% on 204 million shares –
5 over 10 times its normal trading value. Id. See also Oran v. Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 282 (3d Cir.
6 2000) (materiality can be properly measured post hoc by looking to the stock’s price movement in
7 the period immediately following the alleged disclosure).
8

Defendants suggest their statements about Panama’s launch are non-actionable forecasts.

9 Defs.’ Mem. at 14. The statements are actionable because Defendants had no reasonable basis for
10 believing them to be true and, more importantly, had actual knowledge of undisclosed facts that
11 seriously undermined the accuracy of the statements. See Provenz v. Miller, 102 F.3d 1478 (9th Cir.
12 1996). Defendants knew that the critical “solving the blob” project was extremely delayed, no code
13 had been written for Panama as of December 2005, there was under-funding, lack of executive
14 support and terminated engineers that delayed Panama and Panama had failed at least two prior
15 times. ¶¶113(d), 123, 131, 139, 144.13
16

Both Semel and Decker lied to investors on numerous occasions about when increased

17 revenues would be seen from Panama. ¶¶104, 115, 117, 118, 125, 133, 146. Defendants had no
18 reasonable basis for their promises that the real financial impact would be seen in 2006, as they
19 knew about all the problems with Panama. ¶¶113(d), 123, 131, 139, 144. These allegations more
20 than sufficiently identify the particular false and misleading statements and adequately show why the
21 statements were false, thereby satisfying both the PSLRA and Rule 9(b).
22
13
argument that their statements regarding the Panama launch were not false because
23 theDefendants’
second phase of Panama rolled out only three weeks after 3Q06 is highly misleading. In total,
was more than one year late. When Defendants first started giving analysts guidance as to
24 Panama
when Yahoo! would experience revenue from Panama in October 2005, Defendants promised a late
launch and increasing revenues throughout 2006. ¶117. In reality, Panama did not roll out

until February 2007! Foster Decl., Ex. 44. Defendants unpersuasively challenge the relevance of

allegations that the Panama code was not complete as of December 2005. Defs.’ Mem. at

Defendants Are Liable for the Third-Party Statements Alleged in the

Prudential Equity Group stated: “Management noted that revenue-per-search grew sequentially after

Defendants also erroneously claim their statements during the May 17, 2006 analyst day

14
launch. Defs.’ Mem. at 13-14. The conference call transcript shows (Foster Decl., Ex. 31) each
15
Defendant was present when the statements about Panama’s launch were made and therefore each is

liable for the statements. See In re SmarTalk Teleservices, Inc. Sec. Litig., 124 F. Supp. 2d 527, 543

Plaintiffs’ allegations of falsity concerning the success of Yahoo!’s search business and

25 growing revenues are corroborated by numerous CWs. Contrary to well established law in this

2 reinforce one another”). The witness allegations must be accepted as true at the pleading stage.
3 Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2509.
4

The CW accounts in this case easily meet Daou and Oracle. The Complaint identifies each

5 CWs by number, describes their job titles and duties, lists where they worked and their dates of
6 employment. ¶¶20-34; see Daou, 411 F.3d at 1015. Furthermore, the Complaint alleges how the
7 CWs knew about the information they provided. Oracle, 380 F.3d at 1233. Several CWs
8 corroborate the known delays impacting Panama, bolstering the reliability of each witness account.
9 Daou, 411 F.3d at 1015 (the number of sources demonstrates the reliability of those sources).14 The
10 Complaint also identifies other CWs (CW10, CW11, CW12) that corroborate the problems with the
11 Overture integration and new search platform. ¶¶30-32.
Faced with these detailed statements, Defendants also attempt to create factual and

12

13 credibility issues with respect to the CWs, which is improper at the pleading stage. See Lee v. City
14 of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001). For example, Defendants ignore the fact that
15 CW12 was an Operations Sales Manager during the Class Period and in that position had an integral
16 role in the initiation and roll-out of Panama. In challenging the reliability of CW15, Defendants
17 again completely ignore the Complaint’s allegations. Contrary to Defendants’ contentions, the
18 Complaint identifies CW15’s responsibilities, the types of meetings CW15 attended and the details
19 of what was discussed at the meetings. ¶34.15

See ¶20 (CW1 was Vice President of Engineering throughout the Class Period and assigned by
defendant Nazem to lead Panama in October 2005. As part of Yahoo!’s engineering department and
as leader for Panama, CW1 had knowledge of all the delays and problems Panama faced); ¶21
(CW2, a former Yahoo! insider sales manager confirmed that Panama was delayed because of backend (i.e., “solving the blob”) problems); ¶23 (CW4 confirmed that resources weren’t given to
Panama until fall 2005 when Panama moved to Sunnyvale and that, because the “solving the blob”
problem was delayed, making a 3Q06 rollout was not feasible); ¶26 (CW7 confirmed that “solving
the blob” was not complete by February 2006).

15
That CW10 and CW11 left Yahoo! before Defendants began making promises about Panama’s
26 roll-out
dates does not distract from these witnesses’ credibility because others corroborated their
reports.

Contrary to Defendants’ arguments, the consistent theme throughout the CW accounts – that

Yahoo!’s Financial Results Were False and Misleading Because They
Improperly Included Revenues from Click Fraud

8
As a result of the engineering problems detailed above, the Company’s advertising revenue
9
growth was stagnant by the start of the Class Period. ¶4. To bury this problem, Defendants ignored
10
that their sub-par technology was allowing click fraud revenue to be recognized, manipulated the
11
click fraud filters and delayed refunds to fraudulently boost revenues. ¶¶31(k), 31(l). Consequently,
12
Yahoo’s Class Period financial statements were overstated by $387 million (¶¶199-210, 214-223).
13
Consistent with Daou, Plaintiffs have specifically pled, on a quarterly basis, the amount
14
Yahoo! overstated revenue and total net income per share during the Class Period (¶¶56(g), (k),
15
73(g), (k), 79(g), (k), 90(g), (k), 102(g), (k), 113(h), (l), 123(g), (k), 131(d), (h), 139(b), (f)), and how
16
Defendants violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles by including click fraud revenues in
17
Yahoo!’s financial statements and failing to include the accrued liabilities for foreseeable refunds to
18
customers (¶¶202-213).

See Daou, 411 F.3d at 1017 (a plaintiff need only allege enough

19
information for the court to determine that the problems are significant in affecting a company’s
20

“financial statements” and “overall financial position”).17 Further, the Complaint provides detailed

24 bolsters the evidence’s reliability and credibility”).

1 allegations that corroborate the falsity of Yahoo!’s financial statements, including reports from
2 industry experts and analysts who have determined click fraud amounts to be at least 10%, and as
3 much as 30%, of all pay-per-clicks (¶¶204-208) and corroborating accounts by CW3, CW6, CW8,
4 CW9, CW10, CW11 and CW12. ¶¶22, 25, 27-30, 31(l)-(k).18
5

Defendants fasten on to the “turning the dial” allegations rather than considering the full

6 context of the facts alleged in the Complaint and the detail with which all click fraud allegations are
7 pled. Defs.’ Mem. at 8. As confirmed by CW3, CW6, CW9, CW10 and CW11, Yahoo!’s new
8 developing search technology was poorly equipped to filter bad clicks and account for its low quality
9 traffic partners. ¶¶22, 25, 27-30, 31(h). As confirmed by CW9, who worked on Yahoo!’s Click
10 Activity Research team, which was responsible for handling click fraud complaints, Defendants did
11 nothing to block the source of the click fraud (i.e., low quality traffic partners) and chose to include
12 the revenue in the Company’s financial statements, in addition to including improperly recognized
13 revenue from Defendants’ end-of-quarter filter manipulations. ¶28. CW3 also confirmed the
14 Company relaxed its click fraud filters to generate more revenues. ¶22(d). According to CW9,
15 Yahoo! had thousands of low quality content match partners who had an incentive to commit click
16 fraud or increase non-billable clicks since they received a piece of the revenues from Yahoo!, and
17 customer complaints about click fraud always increased at end-of-quarter. ¶28. Contrary to
18 Defendants’ argument, the Company’s settlement of the customer click fraud lawsuit provides
19
20
21 witness reports of a 50% miss in revenue projections provided sufficiently “hard numbers” when
22 confirmed by adequate corroborating details. Oracle, 380 F.3d at 1231.
18
Ironically, Defendants attack the lack of internal documents supporting, and Plaintiffs’ inability to
23 quantify,
the overstated click fraud revenue when Defendants are solely in possession of such
documents,
but have been unwilling to quantify any amounts. Defs.’ Mem. at 8-9. In June 2006,
24 Yahoo! agreed
to settle a customer click fraud lawsuit by providing advertisers with refunds due to
click
fraud
during
the Class Period. In addition, Defendants are vigorously defending a second click
25 fraud lawsuit in California,
in which class certification will not be complete until spring 2009. ¶140.

Because only Defendants have access to the information, cases like Daou have found that allegations
26 of
accounting fraud do not have to raise to the level of particularity Defendants suggest. See
Pirraglia
v. Novell, Inc., 339 F.3d 1182, 1193 n.14 (10th Cir. 2003) (This is especially true “at the
27 pleading stage”
since such specifics “would presumably be kept” in the Company’s “private files.”).

2 Period financial statements. Defs.’ Mem. at 9 n.2; ¶¶140, 147.
3

Defendants incorrectly contend Yahoo! missed investor expectations on four occasions

4 during the Class Period, thereby undermining Plaintiffs’ allegations of click fraud. Defs.’ Mem. at 8.
5 Defendants’ contention is misleading because two of the occasions were the January and July 2006
6 announcements when Defendants disclosed their fraud to investors. ¶¶125, 126, 150. Further, 2Q04
7 and 2Q05 were seasonally weaker quarters where Yahoo! failed to achieve the high end of analyst
8 expectations. Although investors were disappointed, Yahoo! claimed to achieve its own internal
9 guidance and referred to the results as “the best quarter in Yahoo! history” and “record results.”
10 ¶¶62, 104. As alleged in the Complaint, however, Yahoo! only achieved the reported results via
11 improper recognition of click fraud revenue and subsequently went on a media campaign to
12 convince investors that their search business was competitive with Google. ¶69.

The PSLRA’s Safe Harbor Provision Does Not Insulate Defendants
from Liability for Their False and Misleading Statements

14
The safe harbor provision of the PSLRA protects only “‘forward-looking statements
15
identified as such, which are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements,’” and is
16
inapplicable to any “description of past or present events.” LDK Solar, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
17
42425, at *45. Defendants’ false and misleading statements are not protected by the safe harbor (or
18
pre-PSLRA bespeaks caution rule) because they were not forward-looking; and even if they were,
19
they were knowingly false when made and not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.
20
First, Defendants made statements about the current status of the development of Yahoo!’s
21

search business.19 Second, even if Yahoo!’s statements regarding the progress and status of Panama

22
were forward-looking, the safe harbor does not shield Defendants from liability when representations

See, e.g., ¶50 (“Looking at Overture specifically . . . the underlying strategic fit with Yahoo! and
financial
upside to our network has surpassed our original expectations.”); ¶76 (“Our . . . continued
25 investment
in people and infrastructure have led to the increased product quality and powerful rate of
innovation

26 second quarter as are
a result [in part] of our strength in . . . search marketing . . . and our ability to
and perform according to plan.’”); ¶104 (“The new [improving matching algorithms] are
27 execute

1 were known to be false or misleading when made. The Company “may be held liable if the
2 ‘forward-looking statement’ [was] made with ‘actual knowledge . . . the statement was false or
3 misleading.’” Am. West, 320 F.3d at 936. The Complaint alleges numerous detailed facts showing
4 Defendants knew about material problems with Panama, yet failed to disclose them to investors.20
5

Third, even if Defendants’ statements were forward-looking, the cautionary language

6 accompanying the announcements was meaningless because it did not truthfully address the specific
7 risks or disclose existing adverse risks. See Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. v. Arm Fin. Group, No.
8 99 Civ. 12046 (WHP), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3332, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2001) (“warnings of
9 specific risks . . . do not shelter defendants from liability if they fail to disclose hard facts critical to
10 appreciating the magnitude of the risks described”). As the Ninth Circuit recently emphasized,
11 knowingly warning a negative event “might” occur is “quite different” from informing the public it
12 has already “in fact” occurred. Berson, 527 F.3d at 987 (emphasis in original). Clearly, “investors
13 would treat the two differently.” Id. at 990. See In re Copper Mountain Sec. Litig., 311 F. Supp. 2d
14 857, 883 (N.D. Cal 2004) (“‘the inclusion of general cautionary language . . . would not excuse the
15 alleged failure to reveal known material, adverse facts’”).21
16

Defendants argue warnings of the risks relevant to Yahoo!’s search marketing business,

17 notably those in press releases and conference calls from April 7, 2004 to October 18, 2005, are
18 protected by the safe harbor. Defs.’ Mem. at 22. They are not, however, because Defendants were
19 aware these risks had already materialized. Berson, 527 F.3d at 987. By April 7, 2004, the

On an October 18, 2005 conference call, for example, Defendant Decker informed investors the
financial
benefits of Panama would be seen in late 2005 and 2006, despite the Individual
22 Defendants’
knowledge that the search algorithm was slated for launch no earlier than 2Q06. ¶¶3,
20(a),
116,
117.
Also, during a May 17, 2006 analyst day, Defendants provided details of a
23 three-phase Panama
roll-out beginning in 3Q06 and concluding in 4Q06, despite their knowledge
that
a
first-phase
launch
in 3Q06 and full implementation in 4Q06 was impossible. ¶¶8, 143, 144(b).

Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund v. Clorox Co., 353 F.3d 1125

cautions in themselves,” and defendant “identified the important problems with [the

statements assured successful development of the new search algorithm, absent

2 and Yahoo!’s firing of senior engineers. ¶¶3, 29, 30, 56. Also, by April 7, 2004, Defendants knew
3 Yahoo! was adjusting poorly to changes in Overture personnel because Yahoo! had terminated the
4 engineers capable of executing new search technology, causing major delays and obstacles. ¶3, 29,
5 56. Not until the fall of 2005 did Yahoo! begin to dedicate more resources to the development of
6 Panama. ¶¶20(a), 21, 23. The cautionary language cited by Defendants as adequate warnings at the
7 May 17, 2006 analyst day about the three-phase roll-out of Panama in 3Q and 4Q 2006 therefore has
8 no effect, because they already knew they were “unable to adapt [their] systems in a timely manner,”
9 yet continued to assure investors Panama would be successfully executed by the end of 2006. ¶¶8,
10 143. Because Defendants failed “‘to reveal known material, adverse facts’” (Copper Mountain, 311
11 F. Supp. 2d at 883), and did not disclose to investors that the risks addressed in these press releases
12 had already “in fact” occurred (Berson, 527 F.3d at 987) (emphasis in original)), the cautionary
13 language cited by Defendants was meaningless.22
14 IV.

THE COMPLAINT ADEQUATELY ALLEGES SCIENTER

15

To plead scienter under the PSLRA (15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(2)), Plaintiffs’ allegations “taken

16 collectively” must give rise to a strong inference of scienter, and not be viewed as individual
17 allegations “scrutinized in isolation.” Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2509. “The inference that the defendant
18 acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, i.e., of the ‘smoking gun’ genre, or even the ‘most
19 plausible of competing inferences.’” Id. at 2510. Instead, “[w]hen the allegations are accepted as
20 true and taken collectively,” a court need only find that a reasonable person would “deem the
21 inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference.” Id. at 2511. When all of the
22 allegations are considered together as Tellabs mandates, Plaintiffs properly allege that Defendants
23 knowingly (or at least recklessly) made false and misleading statements to the investing public.23
24
25

22

See also Rosenbaum Capital, LLC v. McNulty, 549 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1191 (N.D. Cal. 2008)
(warnings
lose value when defendants publicly stated an acquisition was well integrated when they
26 knew the integration
was “highly problematic”).

The Confidential Witness Accounts Show Defendants Had Actual
Knowledge of the Falsity of Their Statements When Made

2
The Complaint alleges with particularity that the Individual Defendants, all Yahoo! top
3
officers and executives, knew of the falsity of their statements regarding Yahoo!’s search business
4
and the inclusion of click fraud revenues in Yahoo!’s financial statements. ¶¶20-34, 155-178. The
5
CW accounts in the Complaint paint a stunning picture of the Individual Defendants’ personal
6
involvement in every aspect of the key components of Yahoo!’s financial operations during the
7
Class Period – the integration of Overture, the execution of Panama, and the recognition of click
8
fraud revenue – and corroborate allegations showing Defendants knew their statements were false
9
when made. Id.
10
According to CW1, Nazem removed the previous engineer in charge of Panama after it
11
“‘failed miserably’” in July or August 2005. ¶20. CW4 confirmed in October 2005, Nazem yanked
12
Panama from the Overture facilities and based it out of his corporate office, then selected CW1 to
13
lead Panama and placed him/her under “‘a lot of pressure’” to “get [Panama] out there immediately.”
14
¶¶20, 23. Nazem met with CW1 every Wednesday for progress reports on Panama, and CW15 also
15
attended weekly meetings held by Nazem to discuss Panama. ¶¶20(a), 34. CW2 recalled in March
16
2006, Nazem met with sales management in Pasadena to discuss the resources dedicated to Panama.

2 Company’s search monetization. ¶¶20(a), 32, 158.
3

The Complaint also alleges facts showing Defendants knew, or were deliberately reckless in

4 not knowing, that Yahoo!’s financial statements were falsely overstated because they included click
5 fraud revenues. Decker was intimately involved in the Company’s recognition of click fraud
6 revenue. Defendants not only ignore Plaintiffs’ detailed and corroborating witness accounts (¶¶207 34), as well as the extensive additional indicia of scienter (¶¶155-178), but Defendants also attempt
8 to mislead the Court into thinking none of the CWs ever communicated or met with Decker or
9 Semel. Defs.’ Mem. at 17. This simply is not true. CW8 met with Decker to discuss click fraud at
10 Yahoo! in 2005. ¶27. CW10 gave Decker access to the revenue reporting system at Overture. ¶29.
11 CW9 talked to Decker about customer complaints about click fraud. ¶170. Decker had access to the
12 “‘CVS code log’” computer system, in which she could ascertain and even amend the method to
13 determine whether a click was billable. ¶29. CW8, CW9 and CW10 confirmed Defendant Decker
14 was aware of the majority of customer complaints regarding click fraud. ¶¶27-29. Also, in August
15 2005, CW14 and other engineers from CW14’s group had a meeting with Semel and discussed the
16 diminished customer search experience due to increased ads placed to increase revenue. ¶¶33, 178.
17

Customer complaints about click fraud were logged in the customer relationship management

18 system and according to CW9 and CW10, both of whom worked in divisions at Yahoo! dealing with
19 click fraud, Decker reviewed the complaints. ¶¶33, 176, 178. Importantly, CW12 stated there were
20 more complaints from customers about click fraud at the end of each quarter. ¶31. These CW
21 accounts show Decker knew, or was deliberately reckless in not knowing, that click fraud revenues
22 were improperly included in Yahoo!’s revenues each quarter during the Class Period.

The Complaint Also Raises a Strong Inference that Defendants’
Misrepresentations Were Either Made Intentionally or with
Deliberate Recklessness

A strong inference of scienter can be inferred where defendants were high level managers

26 and the accounting fraud had a significant impact on the company’s revenue. Berson, 527 F.3d at
27 987. The Individual Defendants held themselves out as the persons most knowledgeable about the

1 key components of Yahoo!’s financial condition during the Class Period – the integration of
2 Overture, the execution of Panama, and the recognition of click fraud revenue. ¶¶155, 156.
3

A strong inference is warranted because Yahoo!’s false statements and omissions regarding

4 Overture, Panama and click fraud related to its sponsored search business, which provided 40% of
5 the Company’s total revenues. ¶¶3, 157-168, 175-178. In this Circuit, facts critical to a company’s
6 core operations or important transactions are so apparent that knowledge of such facts may be
7 reasonably attributed to the company and its key officers. Berson, 527 F.3d at 989 (“‘absurd to
8 suggest’” top management would be unaware of facts important to company’s business).
9

The Complaint alleges that as top executives and officers at Yahoo!, the Individual

10 Defendants knew about all aspects of Yahoo!’s business operations and participated regularly in
11 meetings where issues about Yahoo!’s search business were discussed, including Panama. ¶¶15-18,
12 159-168. Semel was Yahoo!’s CEO, made numerous public statements during the Class Period
13 about Yahoo!’s search business and click fraud issues, and was briefed on a weekly basis regarding
14 the status of Panama by its leadership team. ¶¶15, 32, 94. Similarly, Rosensweig was Yahoo!’s
15 COO until March 2007 when he left the Company, and spoke numerous times during the Class
16 Period on issues involving Yahoo!’s search business and click fraud. ¶16. Nazem was Yahoo!’s
17 Executive Vice President and CTO and was intimately involved in all aspects of Yahoo!’s business
18 operations, including Panama and click fraud issues, and met weekly during the Class Period with
19 the Panama manager, CW1. ¶¶17, 20(a), 159-168. Decker was Yahoo!’s CFO and intimately
20 involved in monitoring click fraud issues at Yahoo!. ¶18. This is confirmed by CW8 who met with
21 Decker in 2005 about the Company’s click fraud issues and Decker’s firing of CW9, because CW9
22 agreed to an $8,000 click fraud refund for a customer. ¶¶18, 27-28, 117. CW9 reported Decker
23 regularly reviewed customer complaints about click fraud. ¶¶18, 28. These allegations of Decker’s
24 personal involvement, and her position as CFO in charge of revenue, support a strong inference she
25 knew Yahoo!’s financial statements were falsely overstated with click fraud revenues.

Defendants’ Scienter Is Strongly Inferred from Their Signed
Certifications to the SEC

2
Not only did the Defendants hold themselves out as knowledgeable about Yahoo!’s search
3
business and the recognition of click fraud revenue (¶¶155, 156), they also attested to reviewing,
4
designing and certifying the accuracy of Yahoo!’s financial statements and internal controls (¶¶2245
227).
6
As alleged in the Complaint, Yahoo! maintanined a “‘CVS code log’” which provided a
7
method to track changes to the software that determined whether a click was billable, and was used
8
to comply with the controls called for by SOX. ¶172. Thus, when Defendants Semel and Decker
9
signed their certifications they either had actual knowledge that Yahoo!’s software system was not
10
accurately detecting click fraud and did nothing about it, or they recklessly stated on their
11
certifications that they personally evaluated Yahoo!’s controls (which included the CVS system) and
12
they were adequate, which creates a strong inference of scienter. In re Lattice Semiconductor Corp.

The Individual Defendants’ Insider Trading of Yahoo! Stock

The Individual Defendants also engaged in massive insider trading both unusual in timing

17 and amount throughout the Class Period, which supports an inference of scienter. Am. West, 320
18 F.3d at 938-39. See also Daou, 411 F.3d at 1022; Oracle, 380 F.3d at 1232. Throughout the Class
19 Period, each Individual Defendant sold an enormous percentage of his or her Yahoo! stock,
20 dramatically inconsistent with the insider’s prior trading history. ¶¶180-188. First, the amount and

1 suspicious.25 The Complaint alleges the Individual Defendants sold between 84%-90% of their
2 shares during the Class Period, with the proceeds exceeding $879 million.26 Second, a strong
3 inference of scienter is reinforced because Individual Defendants’ insider sales were dramatically out
4 of line with their pre-Class Period sales, constituting only 7% (Semel), 9% (Decker), 8%
5 (Rosensweig) and 39% (Nazem) of their Class Period insider sales.27 See Am. West, 320 F.3d at

7 (N.D. Cal. July 29, 2005) (sales of 18% and 64% during the class period, versus 7% and 29%,
8 respectively, during the prior year, meet the Ninth Circuit’s “‘dramatically out of line standard’”).28
9

Third, the general timing of the insider sales raises suspicion. The Individual Defendants

10 typically sold their Yahoo! stock only on days after issuing favorable, albeit false, statements about
11 the Company – designed to keep share price artificially inflated. ¶180. Even if Individual
12 Defendants sold some Yahoo! stock just after earnings announcements not in line with expectations
13 (Defs.’ Mem. at 20), they were still trading based on known, yet undisclosed, inside information
14 because these statements did not disclose the truth. ¶¶150, 180-188. The Individual Defendants sold
15
25

The length of the Class Period is consistent with Yahoo!’s fraudulent scheme detailed in the
Complaint. On April 7, 2004 (the day before the start of the Class Period), Defendants began to
17 make false statements related to the Company’s new search algorithm, causing its stock price to be
artificially inflated, and on July 18, 2006 (the last day of the Class Period), Defendants made a full
18 disclosure of Yahoo!’s failure to launch the search algorithm as it had promised, and revealed it was
forced to terminate relationships with affiliates known to contribute to click fraud. ¶¶49, 150.
19 26
Plaintiffs calculated the percentage of Yahoo! shares sold during the Class Period based upon the
publicly
available Form 4s for each Individual Defendant filed with the SEC throughout that time.
20 ¶¶181-188.
Even if vested options were included when calculating the percentage of Yahoo! shares
sold
during
the Class Period, as Defendants suggest, the percentage sold by each Individual
21
Defendant is still a significant amount (49.3% for Semel; 68.1% for Rosensweig; 58.1% for Nazem;
22 and 35.6% for Decker). Defs.’ Mem. at 20 n.12.

The Vantive case, heavily relied upon by Defendants, is distinguishable. In re Vantive Corp. Sec.

25 CWs alleging
Yahoo!’s fraudulent scheme. ¶¶20, 34, 155-178. Vantive, by contrast, emphasized the
insider
trading
allegations did not support an inference of scienter in the “context” of “insufficient
26 allegations of fraud
[that] have a spillover effect” onto the court’s analysis. 283 F.3d at 1093, 1096.
Also

The Complaint Pleads with Particularity Facts Demonstrating that
Defendant Nazem Is Liable as a Primary Violator of Section 10(b)

7
Any suggestion by Defendants that Nazem is not primarily liable for violation of Securities
8
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) §10(b), 15 U.S.C. §78j(b), improperly ignores the totality
9
of Plaintiffs’ allegations. Here, Plaintiffs pled Nazem was the CTO at Yahoo! during the Class
10
Period and had knowledge of all the problems that Yahoo! was experiencing with regard to the
11
integration of Overture, the development of the Company’s new search platform and Panama. ¶18.
12
Indeed, as the CTO of an internet media company such as Yahoo!, Nazem was at the center of
13
Defendants’ concealment of the Company’s engineering woes. Nazem participated in the May 17,
14
2006 analyst day conference call where Defendants made false and misleading statements. Nazem
15
cannot shield himself from liability for those statements by arguing that he said nothing during the
16
conference call. See SmarTalk, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 543. Moreover, Nazem dumped over 88% of his
17
Yahoo! shares during the Class Period while in possession of material, non-public information
18
regarding Yahoo!’s fraudulent conduct. ¶187. This is a separate violation of §10(b). See Chiarella
19
v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 230 (1980) (“[S]ilence in connection with the purchase or sale of

1 surrounding the development of Yahoo!’s paid search business (Overture and Panama) and the
2 improper recognition of click fraud revenue which made Defendants’ statements false,30 the
3 disclosures revealing the falsity of Defendants’ statement,31 and the resulting decline in Yahoo!
4 stock on January 18, 2006 and July 18, 2006, after the truth was revealed.32
5

In Dura, the Supreme Court recognized that pleading loss causation is “not meant to impose

6 a great burden upon a plaintiff,” but simply requires a short and plain statement under Federal Rule
7 of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) showing what the relevant loss “might be” and “what the causal
8 connection might be between” the plaintiffs’ loss and the defendants’ misconduct. Dura, 544 U.S. at
9 347.
The Complaint pleads a causal link between Defendants’ January 18, 2006 and July 18, 2006

10

11 disclosures of the Company’s delay in implementing Panama and Plaintiffs’ losses. ¶¶232-234.
12 Defendants’ suggestion there is no loss causation for statements concerning Panama is belied by the
13 market’s reaction to the delays, described by one securities analyst as “‘Panamawful,’” and the
14 major drops in Yahoo!’s stock price as the market absorbed this news. ¶150. The Complaint also
15 pleads a causal link between Defendants’ false financial statements and Plaintiffs’ losses by alleging
16 that on January 18 and July 18, 2006, Yahoo!’s stock plummeted when the Company was forced to
17 announce revenues would decrease because the Company was terminating relationships with lower
18 quality affiliates known to contribute to click fraud.33
19

Defendants argue, inconsistent with Daou, that a specific disclosure regarding improperly

20 recognized revenue is required to establish loss causation. Defs.’ Mem. at 23. In Daou, the Ninth
21
30

See ¶¶3-5, 20-34, 56, 60, 73, 79, 90, 102, 113, 123, 131, 139, 144, 155-178, 199-213.

See ¶¶126-154.

33
Defendants’ arguments that Yahoo! had previously disclosed increasing traffic acquisition costs
25 (“TAC”)
also fail because anticipating higher TAC is not the same as revealing the Company’s
revenues
were
inflated via click fraud. Defs.’ Mem. at 23-26. In January and July 2006, Yahoo!’s
26 stock price declined
because the market became aware Yahoo! had to distance itself from lower
quality
affiliates
that
had been generating revenue via click fraud, and therefore Yahoo!’s TAC
27 would increase because
higher quality affiliates cost more. ¶¶22(e), 28, 29, 126, 127.

1 Circuit rejected the district court’s holding that express disclosures of fraud at the time the stock
2 price dropped were required to plead loss causation. 411 F.3d at 1026.34 Daou found it sufficient
3 under Dura to allege the stock drop was caused by disclosures of negative financial results alleged to
4 be the direct result of improper accounting practices, which is what Plaintiffs have done here. Id.;
5 see ¶¶6, 8, 130, 150. See also Berson, 527 F.3d at 990 (plaintiff adequately pled loss causation
6 where defendants overstated revenues and a stock price decline occurred immediately after
7 defendants revealed the company’s “‘true financial condition’”) (quoting Daou, 411 F.3d at 10258 26).35

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ADEQUATELY ALLEGED AN INSIDER TRADING
CLAIM UNDER SECTION 20A

10
The Complaint alleges a viable §10(b) claim, as well as facts showing the Individual
11
Defendants sold Yahoo! stock contemporaneously with one or more Plaintiff(s) when they possessed
12
material, adverse information unknown to the investing public, and thus are liable under Exchange
13
Act §20A, 15 U.S.C. §78t-1. ¶¶2, 262-270; Shurkin v. Golden State Vintners, Inc., 471 F. Supp. 2d
14
998, 1026 (N.D. Cal. 2006). In re VeriFone Securities Litigation, 11 F.3d 865, 870, 872 (9th Cir.
15
1993) does not require Plaintiffs specify the precise, material non-public information possessed by
16
Defendants at the exact moment they sell stock. The knowledge requirement is not heightened as
17
Defendants suggest; Plaintiffs need only allege scienter as to their §10(b) claims to adequately allege
18
Defendants knew material, non-public information when selling Yahoo! stock. Id.

Metzler, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 15935, does not overrule Daou, and the Complaint adequately
pleads loss causation under Daou. Metzler is distinguishable regardless, because Defendants therein
issued two announcements that did not disclose, or even suggest, to the market that the Company
was engaged in the fraudulent activity alleged to have caused Plaintiffs’ losses. Id. at *27-*28, *31.
Here, unlike Metzler, in January and July 2006 Yahoo! specifically disclosed the truth about key
components of the fraud alleged – delays in the execution of Panama, as well as declines in revenue
because it was terminating relationships with lower quality affiliates to reduce click fraud. ¶¶6, 126,
127, 150.

35
Defendants’ suggestion that the financial statements were not false because they were never
25 “questioned”
by anyone, including the Company’s auditors, is wrong. Defs.’ Mem. at 23. In LDK
Solar,
2008
U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 42425, the court rejected this argument stating “‘the fact that the
26 financial statements
for the year in question were not restated does not end [the plaintiff’s] case
when
he
has
otherwise
the pleading requirements of the PSLRA. To hold otherwise would
27 shift to accountants the meet
responsibility that belongs to the courts.’” Id. at *31-*32.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ADEQUATELY ALLEGED CONTROL PERSON
LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 20(a)

2
Because Plaintiffs have properly pled a §10(b) violation, they may prevail on their Exchange
3
Act §20(a), 15 U.S.C. §78t(a), claim because the Complaint sets forth how each Defendant not only
4
had direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company, but also
5
exercised his or her power to influence and control the decision-making of Yahoo! and the content
6
and dissemination of the statements identified by Plaintiffs as false and misleading. LDK Solar, U.S.

do not contest Plaintiffs have pled the control relationship with sufficient particularity
24 as Defendants
to Defendants Decker and Semel, and assert these two Defendants can escape liability under
only if the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ §10(b) claims. Defs.’ Mem. at 24-25. During the Class
25 §20(a)
Period, Defendant Nazem was Executive Vice President and Yahoo!’s CTO and defendant
was COO. ¶¶16, 17. Both were intimately involved in the preparation of Yahoo!’s
26 Rosensweig
financial statements, including decisions on disclosures of internal controls, and reviewed and
approved SEC filings and Annual Reports to Shareholders. Id. Rosensweig regularly participated in
27 conference
calls for the investment community. ¶¶50, 62, 76, 82, 94, 96, 104, 115.
