PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT MOTION TO SEAL
Plaintiff, by counsel, pursuant to Rule 5 of the Local Rules of the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, hereby moves to seal Exhibit 1 attached to Plaintiff’s
Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compel and For Sanctions (Dkt. 42), as well as the
portion of Plaintiff’s memorandum that quotes a provision in Exhibit 1. In support thereof,
Plaintiff states as follows:
Plaintiff needed to file Exhibit 1, which was designated as confidential by Defendant.
Plaintiff also quoted directly from Exhibit 1, requiring the filing of the redacted memorandum.
While Plaintiff disagrees that the Defendant properly designated the information as confidential,
Plaintiff nonetheless moves the Court to temporarily seal the exhibit and memorandum in
accordance with Local Rule 5 until such time as Defendant’s designations may be ruled upon by
the Court.
Respectfully submitted,
BRIAN TAYLOR
By: ______/s/_____________________
