UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
OCALA DIVISION
CHERYL RAFFERTY, on
behalf of herself and all others
similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

Case No: 5:17-cv-426-Oc-40PRL

v.
RETRIEVAL-MASTERS CREDITORS
BUREAU, INC., doing business as
RMCB COLLECTION AGENCY,
and John Does 1-25,
Defendants.
-------------------------------------------/
MOTION TO AMEND/SUBSTITUTE
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Plaintiff, Cheryl Rafferty, through her undersigned counsel, files this Motion to
Amend/Substitute her Complaint to add Jeffrey S. Wollman as Defendants and states as follows1:
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
This case is brought under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA) relating to a
debt collections letter sent to Plaintiff dated June 7, 2017 (a copy of which was attached as
Exhibit 1 to Defendant’s Answer). On January 12, 2018, Plaintiff propounded discovery on
Defendant which included the following Interrogatory Number 8:
State the names, employer and addresses of any persons who drafted and/or
approved of the letter attached as Exhibit 1 to Defendant’s Answer and describe
their role in drafting or approving it.

1

On March 1, 2018, the Court declined not to continue to grant extensions on an indefinite
piecemeal basis and thus denied without prejudice a motion to extend the deadline to add parties
and amend the pleadings. DE 55.

Case 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL Document 73 Filed 05/08/18 Page 2 of 5 PageID 595

After being ordered to do so, on May 2, 2018, Defendant responded to Interrogatory Number 8
which now states2:
The subject letter has been in existence and use for over fifteen years and
RMCB has no record of who initially drafted, approved and/or created the letter.
The subject letter has not since been redrafted, reapproved and/or recreated.
When RMCB received electronic data from the creditor, Swiss Colony, regarding
unpaid, outstanding account balances, RMCB’s IT team uploads that data into
RMCB’s systems, which triggers collection correspondence to be populated
regarding the individual who owes the account balance to Swiss Colony, and then
mailed. There is no “drafting” or “approval” process with that, and the form of
the subject letter was created over 15 years ago. Therefore, only the IT team has
direct involvement with the inputting of a debtor’s specific data into the letter.
This team only performs IT functions, and are not debt collectors (i.e. they are
located in Defendant’s sever room, and do not perform any debt collection
activities).
Jeffrey S. Wollman, Defendant’s Chief Financial Officer, is responsible
for the review and legal compliance affairs for RMCB, which includes the
responsibility for the compliance of the letter. Mr. Wollman has been employed
by RMCB for over twenty years. While Mr. Wollman did not initially draft or
approve the letter, and did not subsequently perform a review or revision of the
letter; as CFO, he oversaw compliance for the letter generally, and oversaw the
continued use of the letter without modifications or revisions. To the best of Mr.
Wollman’s knowledge, the form of the subject letter has never been determined to
violate the law. Mr. Wollman is also generally responsible for the automated
process that resulted in the subject letter being mailed to Plaintiff, but he did not
participate in any individualized decision to send the letter to Plaintiff. There was
no individualized decision taken by any one person at RMCB to send the subject
letter to Plaintiff; a computer dated and addressed the subject letter, based upon an
automated process. Mr. Wollman oversaw the business relationship between
RMCB and Swiss Colony that ultimately resulted in Swiss Colony sending the
subject unpaid, outstanding account balance, along with other unpaid accounts, to
RMCB for collection purposes. Mr. Wollman may be reached via undersigned
counsel.
(e.s.). See attached Exhibit A.

The amended version of Defendant’s response to integratory 8 deletes the first sentence from
the prior version of the interrogatory response that “RMCB has no responsive information to this
interrogatory.”

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant’s response to Interrogatory Number 8 shows that Jeffrey S. Wollman,
Defendant’s Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for the review and legal compliance affairs
for RMCB, which includes the responsibility for the compliance of the letter at issue in this case.
He is responsible for the automated process that resulted in the subject letter being mailed to
Plaintiff. He oversaw compliance for the letter generally, and oversaw the continued use of the
letter without modifications or revisions.
The FDCPA defines the term "debt collector" to include "any person who uses any
instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of
which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or
indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another." 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6). Most
district courts that have addressed the issue of personal liability have held that the corporate
structure does not insulate shareholders, officers, or directors from personal liability under the
FDCPA. See e.g. Schwarm v. Craighead, 552 F.Supp.2d 1056 (E.D. Cal.2008).
For example, in Musso v. Seiders, 194 F.R.D. 43, (D.Conn. 1999), the court explained:
The same reasoning applies to this case. The plaintiff does not seek to hold the
defendant liable simply by virtue of his position with CRA; rather, she alleges that
he is personally liable as a debt collector because he knew of the allegedly
unlawful procedures being used but nevertheless approved or ratified them. The
plaintiff has stated a claim under the FDCPA against the defendant in his
individual capacity. Therefore, the defendant's motion must fail.
(e.s.). Similarly, in Schmidt v. Synergetic Communications, Inc., Avaveo, and Ken Walsh, Case
No. 2:14-cv-539-FtM-29CM, Dist. Court, MD Florida 2015, this Court held:
The Complaint states that Orlando and Caraveo were acting as corporate officers
of Synergetic when the allegedly improper collection efforts took place. (Doc. #1,
¶¶ 6-7.) It is further alleged that Orlando and Caraveo, by virtue of their positions
within Synergetic, controlled and directed Synergetic's collection practices,
including the practices alleged to have violated the FCCPA and FDCPA in this
case. (Id. at ¶¶ 17-18.) These allegations are sufficient to allege FCCPA and
3

Case 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL Document 73 Filed 05/08/18 Page 4 of 5 PageID 597

FDCPA causes of action against Orlando and Caraveo in their individual
capacities. See Arlozynski, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 1310 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (permitting
causes of action against individual defendants alleged to "control and direct the
debt collection practices" of the corporate defendant).
See Cruz v. Int'l Collection Corp., 673 F.3d 991, 999 (9th Cir. 2012) (sole owner, officer, and
director of corporation may be considered a "debt collector"); Kistner v. Law Offices of Michael
P. Margelefsky, LLC, 518 F.3d 433, 437 (6th Cir. 2008) (finding sole member of LLC may be
personally liable on the basis of his participation in the debt collection activities of the LLC more
generally); Teng v. Metro. Retail Recovery Inc., 851 F. Supp. 61, 67 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (finding
that President and Manager of debt collection agency are “debt collectors” under FDCPA
language).
A copy of the proposed Amended Complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit B. It
substitutes the previously unknown Jon Does with Jeffrey S. Wollman and describes his role in
sending the letter.
Aside from adding Mr. Wollman, the proposed Amended Complaint also adds the
allegation to paragraph 6 that “the alleged debt in this case is related to one or more gifts Plaintiff
made to friends for their personal use.” As evidenced per Plaintiff’s declaration attached hereto
as Exhibit C, the alleged debt is consumer related.3
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the court permit the filing and service of the attached
Amended Complaint.
