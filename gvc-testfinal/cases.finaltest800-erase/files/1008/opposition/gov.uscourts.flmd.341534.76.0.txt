Defendants.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND
Defendant Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau Inc. ("RMCB"), through its undersigned
counsel, responds to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend [DE 73], and requests that the Court
deny that Motion and grant RMCB whatever relief it deems appropriate for opposing the Motion,
and in support of its opposition states as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff filed this action on September 20, 2017, alleging that the content of the RMCB
collection letter to her overshadowed certain rights that were referenced on the front side of the
letter in bold and "all caps" print and included, in full, on the backside. Plaintiff alleged this
violated section 1692g of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA"), 15 U.S.C. § 1692
et seq. RMCB filed its Answer to the Complaint on November 14, 2017. [DE 13]. Hours after
the Answer had been filed, Plaintiff, on that same day, moved for judgment on the pleadings or,
in the alternative, for summary judgment. 1 [DE 14]. Plaintiff moved for class certification on
April 4, 2018. [DE 62]. Now that this matter has been pending for months and a dispositive

motion has been fully briefed, Plaintiff wants to add a defendant and to amend the Complaint to
add material factual allegations regarding the nature of the obligation in question. 2
Plaintiff's Motion to Amend should be denied in its entirety3 because the deadline to add
parties or to amend the pleadings under the Case Management and Scheduling Order has passed
[DE 43] and Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of showing diligence. This is because
Plaintiff cannot establish that Jeffrey Wollman, the Chief Financial Officer for RMCB, and his
role in legal compliance for RMCB's collection work was not known to Plaintiff well in advance
of the amendment deadline. In fact, Plaintiff was put on notice of Mr. Wollman's role in
overseeing legal compliance as early as January 4, 2018. [See DE 35-4, ¶ 3].
Plaintiff also is unable to establish that prior to the amendment deadline she was not in
possession of the factual allegations she now seeks to add to the Complaint that the outstanding
account balance was a FDCPA consumer debt. First, Plaintiff does not argue that she was not in
possession of those factual allegations prior to the amendment deadline. In fact, the Declaration
she filed as part of this Motion shows that it would be impossible for her to argue in good faith
that she was not in possession of the factual allegations she now wants to add on the FDCPA
consumer debt issue at the time to action was commenced. [See DE 73-3]. Second, Plaintiff was
given leave to file a reply in support of her Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [DE 54] on the
basis that Plaintiff wanted to address the FDCPA consumer debt issue [see generally DE 46], but

2 When Plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, she
represented to the Court that the pleadings were closed, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). That Rule
expressly states: After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move
for judgment on the pleadings. (emphasis supplied). Plaintiff was under no obligation or deadline to file a
dispositive motion when she did. In Plaintiff's rush to engage in motion practice, RMCB maintains that
she waived the any right she may have had to amend the pleadings because she knowingly took action
procedurally under a Rule that required the pleadings to be closed.
3 At the outset, it should be noted that Plaintiff's Motion is devoid of any law regarding the procedural
rule or standard the Court is to apply in deciding this Motion. What is more, Plaintiff's Motion is devoid
of any justification as to why she is entitled at this juncture of the case to the relief she is requesting.

curiously her Reply makes absolutely no mention of the factual allegations she now seeks to add
to the Complaint. 4 [see generally DE 56]. Plaintiff's failure to properly and timely support the
Complaint with factual allegations regarding an alleged FDCPA consumer debt is fatal to
Plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff's attempt to resurrect that claim at this late stage via the declaration
and amendment to the Complaint is impermissible because a party may not make new factual
allegations or submit an affidavit as part of a reply to a motion, which, in essence, Plaintiff is
attempting to do now. In addition, given that the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is fully
briefed, RMCB would be unfairly prejudiced should the Court permit the FDCPA consumer debt
amendment because a substantial portion of the briefing on the Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings was allocated towards that issue. By allowing the amendment, the Court would moot
that substantial portion of the briefing and would amount to a waste of the Court's and the
Parties' resources. 5 Plaintiff has failed to meet the very high burden of justifying this belated
amendment of the operative pleadings. Furthermore, Plaintiff's amended complaint is futile,
which also warrants the denial of Plaintiff's motion.
ARGUMENT
A.

Standard

In analyzing whether to grant a motion to amend pleadings after the deadline set forth in
a scheduling order, the Eleventh Circuit's precedent requires a showing of diligence by the
moving party, to meet the burden of establishing good cause. This good cause standard precludes
modification unless the schedule cannot 'be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the

4 If Plaintiff was going to allege facts regarding a FDCPA consumer debt, the time to have done that
would have been prior to moving for judgment on the pleadings. Not after the parties expended
substantial resources in briefing a dispositive motion.
5 Even if the Court is included to allow the substitution of an individual defendant, which Defendant
opposes for the reasons set forth below, the Court should still deny Plaintiff's request to include additional
factual allegations regarding the nature of the debt.

In Sosa, the court considered three factors in assessing diligence exercised in
meeting the deadline set in the scheduling order for amending the complaint: 1)
the plaintiff failed to ascertain facts prior to filing the complaint and to acquire
information during the discovery period; 2) the information supporting the
proposed amendment was available to the plaintiff; and 3) even after acquiring
information, the plaintiff delayed in asking for amendment.

B.

Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Should Be Denied in its Entirety Because the
Deadline to Add Parties or to Amend the Pleadings under the Case
Management and Scheduling Order Has Passed, Plaintiff Has Failed to Meet
Her Burden of Showing Diligence and Permitting the Amendments Would be
Unduly Prejudicial to RMCB.

In her motion, Plaintiff has not met her burden of showing diligence in filing a motion to
amend the operative complaint after the expiration of the deadline in this Court's discovery order,
and does not address her rigorous burden.
i.

FDCPA Consumer Debt Amendment.

Plaintiff seeks to amend the Complaint to include additional allegations regarding the
nature of the obligation at issue, and to include an individual Defendant. Plaintiff cannot claim
diligence as to the amendment of the allegations regarding the nature of the obligation at issue.
Plaintiff cannot point to any new information that was not available to her prior to filing this
action that gave rise to the current request to amend the Complaint. Instead, Plaintiff merely cites
to a declaration that she executed on March 23, 2018. See Rafferty Declaration [DE 73-3]. Not
only is the declaration based on information that was previously available to Plaintiff, but the
declaration itself was available to Plaintiff prior to the expiration of the deadline to amend the
pleadings. Importantly, Plaintiff does not argue that she was not in possession of those factual
allegations prior to the amendment deadline.
While the proposed amendment regarding the FDCPA consumer debt issue may appear
to be minor, it is material and relevant in light of the current procedural posture of this case.
Plaintiff has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, motion for
summary judgment. [DE 14]. A substantial portion of the briefing on that motion has involved

Case 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL Document 76 Filed 05/22/18 Page 6 of 13 PageID 704
Case No.: 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL

the failure of Plaintiff to prove in that motion that the unpaid, outstanding account balance at
issue was a consumer debt. See generally [DE 14, 35, 46, and 56]. Plaintiff now seeks to
essentially moot all briefing on this issue by amending the complaint as it relates to the issue of
whether the subject unpaid, outstanding account balance was a FDCPA consumer debt. 6
The fact that Plaintiff was not diligent in seeking to amend the Complaint is underscored
by the fact that Plaintiff was given leave to file a reply in support of her Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings [DE 54] on the basis that Plaintiff wanted to address this very FDCPA consumer
debt issue [see generally DE 46], but curiously her Reply made no mention of the factual
allegations she now seeks to add to the Complaint. [see generally DE 56]. In essence, Plaintiff
is now seeking a third kick at the can in an attempt to resurrect her FDCPA claim. Plaintiff, and
not this Court or RMCB, made the strategic decision to file a dispositive motion when she did.
RMCB should not be punished for Plaintiff's ill strategic decision-making by undoing the

6 The FDCPA applies to only consumer debt. Zimmerman v. HBO Affiliate Grp., 834 F.2d 1163, 1167
(3rd Cir. 1987); see also Pollice v. National Tax Funding, L.P., 225 F.3d 379, 400 (3rd Cir. 2000);
Gorbaty v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 2009 WL 4642371, *2 (3rd Cir.); Garcia v. LVNV
Funding, LLC, 2009 WL 3079962, *3 - *5 (W.D. Tex); Fuller v. Becker & Poliakoff, P.A., 192 F.
Supp. 2d 1361, 1366 (M.D. Fla. 2002); Martin v. Berke & Spielfogel, 1995 WL 214453, *4 (E.D. Pa.).
A consumer debt is defined as any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising
out of a transaction in which the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal, family or household
purposes. 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(5). In Anderson v. Afni, 2011 WL 1808779 (E.D. Pa.), a case involving
claims under the FDCPA, the court granted summary judgment to the defendant debt collector because
the plaintiff did not come forward with sufficient evidence to show that the debt collector was collection a
consumer debt. The Anderson court reasoned that simply because a debt collector is collecting from an
individual at his/her residential address does not give rise to a reasonable inference, for purposes of the
summary judgment framework, that a consumer debt is at issue. 2011 WL 1808779 at *13 - *14. That a
consumer debt exists simply because collection efforts are targeting an individual at his/her residence is
nothing more than conjecture or speculation. Id.; see also Holman v. W. Valley Collection Serv., Inc.,
60 F.Supp.2d 935, 937 (D. Minn. 1999) (“[I]f a communication to the debtor's home converted any
commercial debt into an obligation under the FDCPA, it would be tantamount to an amendment of the
clear intent of Congress.”). Similarly, in Garcia, 2009 WL 3079962, the defendant debt collectors in
moving for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s FDCPA claim argued that because the plaintiff denied
that the underlying indebtedness was his own he could not produce any evidence regarding whether the
subject of the indebtedness was primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Thus, according to
defendants in Garcia, there was a lack of evidence that the plaintiff had been the object of collection
activity arising from consumer debt. 2009 WL 3079962, *3 - *4.

briefing on the pending dispositive motion that the parties and the Court have expended
significant resources in briefing and overseeing. In addition, Plaintiff, in essence, is attempting
to introduce new allegations of fact in a sur-reply to the Motion for Judgment on the pleadings.
This practice of introducing new facts in reply or submitting a declaration as part of a reply has
been held to be impressible. Gold v. Wolpert, 876 F.2d 1327 at n.6 (7th Cir. 1989); Vargas v.
Michaels Stores, Inc., No. 8:16-cv-1949-T-33JSS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105643, *40 (M.D.
Fla. July 10, 2017); TCC Air Servs. v. Schlesinger, No. 05-80543-CIV-RYSKAMP/VITUNA
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21010, *19 (S.D. Fla. Mach 5, 2009). As a result, the Court should deny
Plaintiff's motion to amend the Complaint to add factual allegations regarding the FDCPA
consumer debt issue.
ii.

Jeffrey Wollman as an additional defendant.

Furthermore, Plaintiff has not shown any diligence in her lack of knowledge of Mr.
Wollman as an individual Defendant in this action. Plaintiff does not set forth any claim of
diligence as it relates to the discovery of Mr. Wollman, as required by the Eleventh Circuit.
Therefore, her motion should be denied.
Plaintiff has failed to avail herself of a wide variety of discovery mechanisms available to
her during the discovery period in this case, never noticing any depositions. Plaintiff knew, as
early as January 4, 2018, that Mr. Wollman was the individual responsible for the legal
compliance affairs for RMCB, when a declaration to that effect was filed with the Court, further
stating that he was familiar with the collection letter at issue in this matter. See Declaration of
Jeffrey Wollman [DE 35-4]. This fact is underscored by the fact that Plaintiff's very own Motion
to Amend states, in part, that the basis for adding Mr. Wollman as a defendant, as follows:
……Defendant’s Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for the
review and legal compliance affairs for RMCB, which includes the
responsibility for the compliance of the letter at issue in this case.

Case No.: 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL

[DE 73, p. 3]. Mr. Wollman's job duties in regards to legal compliance were clearly disclosed in
the January 4, 2018 declaration that was filed. Any attempt by Plaintiff to argue that she was not
aware of Mr. Wollman's role in compliance would be disingenuous.
Notwithstanding the parties' disagreement over the scope and language of Plaintiff's
interrogatory as to the approval and drafting of the letter at issue in this matter, for more than 4
months, Plaintiff has known that Mr. Wollman is the head of compliance at RMCB.
Furthermore, Plaintiff's motions demonstrate that she knew that Mr. Wollman was previously
responsible for reviewing drafting and revising collection notices. See Plaintiff's motion to
compel [DE 57, p. 7]. Plaintiff has not met her burden of showing diligence, and therefore, her
motion should be denied.
C.

Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Should be Denied Because the Proposed
Amendments Would be Futile.

In addition to denying the motion for leave to amend for the failure to demonstrate
diligence, Courts can deny any amendment that is futile. "[T]he denial of leave to amend is
justified by futility when the complaint as amended is still subject to dismissal.” Burger King
Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1320 (11th Cir. 1999).
Here, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint seeks injunctive relief against Mr. Wollman under
the FDCPA, despite such relief being unavailable to Plaintiff or a class under the FDCPA. See 15
U.S.C. 1692k; see also Bonanno v. New Penn Fin., LLC, No. 5:17-cv-229-Oc-30PRL, 2017
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118407, at *13 (M.D. Fla. July 28, 2017)(citing Sibley v. Fulton DeKalb
Collection Serv., 677 F.2d 830, 834 (11th Cir. 1982)). This inclusion of relief that is unavailable
to Plaintiff and the putative class under the FDCPA renders the requested amendment futile, and
should lead the Court to deny the current motion.

Case No.: 5:17-cv-00426-PGB-PRL

Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Mr. Wollman for personal
liability, further making the requested amendment futile. Plaintiff fails to adequately allege facts
that Mr. Wollman communicated with her, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g. Plaintiff alleges that
Mr. Wollman was a debt collector, but fails to allege that Mr. Wollman personally
communicated with Plaintiff. The allegations and arguments that Mr. Wollman is a debt
collector, while an element of Plaintiff's claims, do not state a claim. Individuals can be debt
collectors under the FDCPA but the allegations of the proposed amended complaint do not state
a claim against Mr. Wollman under § 1692g.
Section 1692g creates certain requirements for mandatory disclosures within 5 days of
the initial communication from a debt collector to a consumer. There are no allegations that Mr.
Rafferty ever had an initial communication with Mr. Rafferty as necessary to trigger the
requirements of 1692g. Instead the letter attached to the complaint clearly demonstrates that it
was from RMCB. Therefore, there are no allegations in the complaint that show that Mr.
Wollman individually ever communicated with Plaintiff.
The 1692g language on the letter, clarifies that RMCB would obtain verification if the
obligation in question was disputed by Plaintiff. Accepting Plaintiff's erroneous theory, that the
letter from RMCB was an initial communication from not only RMCB, but also from Mr.
Wollman, a plain reading of 1692g would require disclosures that not only RMCB, but also Mr.
Wollman personally would comply with 1692g: the theory would create an individual duty for
Mr. Wollman to personally obtain verification separate and distinct from that of RMCB to
provide disclosures under 1692g. This absurdity would require debt collectors to verify all
possible individuals who could be considered debt collectors within their organization, and
include them by name in the 1692g disclosures, as they would have individual duties under

1692g as debt collectors. Nothing in 1692 supports the proposition that an initial communication
can be from multiple debt collectors, and create 1692g liability for each of them.
The cases cited by Defendant from this district do not clearly state that an individual can
be liable under 1692g. In Schmidt v. Synergentic Communs., Inc., No. 2:14-cv-539-FtM-29CM,
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6209, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2015), the court analyzed 1692e
claims. 7 Section 1692e, states that "[a] debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or
misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt" and then
elaborates on that general prohibition. This provision broadly covers activity in connection with
the collection of a debt, and is much broader than the affirmative requirements of 1692g, which
is triggered only by an initial communication from a debt collector. If a debt collector does not
have an initial communication with a consumer, there can be no claim under 1692g. Plaintiff has
failed to allege an initial communication from Mr. Wollman, and has therefore failed to state a
claim against him under 1692g.
Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because she has impermissibly engaged
in shotgun pleading by comingling the allegations against Mr. Wollman and RMCB. The
Eleventh Circuit has identified four types of prohibited shotgun pleadings:
The most common type — by a long shot — is a complaint containing multiple
counts where each count adopts the allegations of all preceding counts, causing
each successive count to carry all that came before and the last count to be a
combination of the entire complaint. The next most common type, at least as far
as our published opinions on the subject reflect, is a complaint that does not
commit the mortal sin of re-alleging all preceding counts but is guilty of the
venial sin of being replete with conclusory, vague, and immaterial facts not
obviously connected to any particular cause of action. The third type of shotgun
pleading is one that commits the sin of not separating into a different count each
cause of action or claim for relief. Link to the text of the note Fourth, and finally,
there is the relatively rare sin of asserting multiple claims against multiple
7 In the primary opinion cited in Schmight, the claims at issue appeared to involve 1692e(11)
claims, again a much broader section than 1692g. See Arlozynski v. Rubin & Debski, P.A., 710
F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1309 (M.D. Fla. 2010).

defendants without specifying which of the defendants are responsible for which
acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is brought against. The
unifying characteristic of all types of shotgun pleadings is that they fail to one
degree or another, and in one way or another, to give the defendants adequate
notice of the claims against them and the grounds upon which each claim rests.
Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1321-23 (11th Cir. 2015). Shotgun
pleading is therefore grounds for dismissal. See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 516
F.3d 955, 979 (11th Cir. 2008) (discussing shotgun pleadings as something that "this court has
been roundly, repeatedly, and consistently condemning for years"); see also Strategic Income
Fund, L.L.C. v. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Corp., 305 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir. 2002); Harvick v.
Oak Hammock Pres. Cmty. Owners Ass'n, No. 6:14-cv-937-Orl-40GJK, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
187979, at *13 (M.D. Fla. July 22, 2015) (directing pro se plaintiff to "not incorporate by
reference the factual allegations of any previous count into another count.")
Plaintiff fails to allege how Mr. Wollman is individually liable separate and distinct from
its claims against RMCB. Count II of Plaintiff's complaint attempts to incorporate the entirety of
Count I into it. This places the amended complaint squarely within the first category of shotgun
pleading prohibit by the Eleventh Circuit. Plaintiff seeks to hold an individual liable without
parsing out the allegations that she is directing at the individual versus the allegations she is
directing at RMCB.
It should also be noted that courts that have considered whether a corporate officer may
be liable under the FDCPA have, at least, found that the corporate officer actually engaged in
debt collection activity regarding the subject debt. See White v. Goodman, 200 F. 3d 1016 (7th
Cir. 2000). Here, Plaintiff cannot establish that regarding Mr. Wollman. Also, the FDCPA
should not be interpreted “to create bizarre results likely beyond the scope of Congress’ intent in
enacting the statute.” Strand v. Diversified Collection Service, Inc., 380 F.3d 316, 318 (8th Cir.
2004). Here, Plaintiff is asking the Court to add Mr. Wollman as a defendant simply because he

is a corporate officer, which is the very bizarre result that should be avoided. Therefore, the
Court should deny the motion for leave to amend because the shotgun pleading fails to state a
claim, and the proposed amendment is therefore futile.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to show that she was diligent in failing to comply
with this Court's scheduling order. Furthermore, Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint is futile
because it failed to state a claim and engaged in prohibited shotgun pleading. Both of these
failings are fatal to Plaintiff's motion, and should lead the Court to deny the motion for leave to
amend.

WHEREFORE, RMCB respectfully requests this Court enter an order denying Plaintiff's
motion for leave to amend/ substitute, and grant RMCB any relief the Court deems appropriate in
regards to it responding to the subject motion.
