PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ENTRY OF AN ORDER AUTHORIZING COMCAST
TO COMPLY WITH A THIRD PARTY SUBPOENA
Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), hereby moves for entry of an order
authorizing Comcast to comply with Plaintiff’s third party subpoena, and states:
1.

Plaintiff established a direct TCP/IP connection with a computer using

Defendant’s IP Address.
2.

In response to a subpoena requesting that Comcast Cable Communications

(“Comcast” or the “ISP”) identify the subscriber of IP address 98.220.43.119 on July 30, 2012,
Comcast identified Defendant Michael Harrison as the applicable subscriber.
3.

Plaintiff intends to serve a Subpoena Duces Tecum for Deposition (the

“Subpoena”) on Comcast.
4.

The scope of the Subpoena will be limited to documents and Fed.R.Civ.P.

30(b)(6) deposition topics that refer or relate to:

1

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 197 Filed 07/09/14 Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 1366

(a)

Plaintiff’s ability to lay the foundation for the introduction of the correlation of IP
Address to subscriber for purposes of use at trial (i.e., laying the foundation that the
correlating documents produced by the ISPs are business records);

(b)

Information about the reliability of the ISP’s correlating technique;

(c)

DMCA notices and if applicable six strike notices sent to the Defendant;

(d)

Defendant’s Bandwidth usage;

(e)

The number of Comcast internet subscribers in Indiana in July 2012;

(f)

The ratio of IP addresses to internet subscribers as of July 2012.

5.

Each of the above categories of documents and Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) deposition

topics is highly relevant. Indeed, if Plaintiff cannot introduce the correlating evidence into trial
then Plaintiff will lose this case. It is quite simply outcome dispositive. The reliability of the
ISP’s correlating techniques is also highly relevant.

In a previous deposition, Comcast’s

30(b)(6) witness testified that Comcast was “absolutely certain” that its correlation was accurate;
this virtually eliminates any argument that there was a misidentification at the ISP correlation
level. DMCA notices and six strike notices are relevant because these notices may prove a
pattern of infringement or notice that infringement is occurring or both. Bandwidth usage is
relevant because people who are heavy BitTorrent users use significantly more bandwidth than
normal internet users. Finally, information about the number of internet subscribers and ratio of
IP addresses to subscribers is relevant to any defense which may be asserted by Defendant
claiming that the IP address was not assigned to Defendant at all relevant times.
6.

A deposition is needed: (a) so that Plaintiff can avoid surprises at trial and

properly prepare for trial; and (b) because if the ISP ignores a trial subpoena Plaintiff needs to be
able to read the ISP’s deposition into evidence. Also, Plaintiff intends to seek Defendant’s

stipulation to reading the deposition into evidence at trial so as to avoid the necessity of having
the ISP appear as witness. Alternatively, if Comcast does not appear in response to a subpoena
at trial, Plaintiff can read the deposition into evidence.
7.

Pursuant to the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551(c), a court order authorizing the ISP to

comply with the subpoena is necessary.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court enter an order authorizing the
ISP to comply with the subpoena duces tecum for deposition. A proposed order is attached for
the Court’s convenience.
Dated: July 9, 2014.
