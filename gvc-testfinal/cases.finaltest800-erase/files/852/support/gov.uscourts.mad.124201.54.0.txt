DEFENDANTS.
DEFENDANTS’1 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF THEIR
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS AGAINST PLAINTIFFS’
ERISA CAUSES OF ACTION
I.

INTRODUCTION
Patricia Cavallaro and Monique Herman (“Plaintiffs”) filed the present action on behalf of

themselves and a putative class who allegedly “were suffered or permitted to work by defendants and
not paid their regular or statutorily required rate of pay for all hours worked.” First Amended
Complaint-Class Action and Demand for Jury Trial (the “Amended Complaint” or “Am.
Compl.”) (Dkt. # 48) ¶ 26. Plaintiffs assert four different causes of action, but each is based on an

For purposes of this Motion, “Defendants” collectively refers to the following named defendants in
the above-styled action: UMass Memorial Health Care, Inc.; UMass Memorial Hospitals, Inc.; UMass
Memorial Medical Center, Inc.; HealthAlliance Hospitals, Inc.; Marlborough Hospital; The Clinton
Hospital Association; Wing Memorial Hospital Corporation, and UMass Memorial Health Care
401(K).

identical factual predicate: that Plaintiffs were allegedly not compensated for work they performed
during meal breaks, before and after their scheduled work shifts, and while attending various training
programs in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq. (“FLSA”) .
Among Plaintiffs’ four causes of action are two claims under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) for alleged recordkeeping and fiduciary duty violations
(Causes of Action II and III).

As discussed herein, these causes of action must be

dismissed because they fail to state viable claims for relief. An examination of Plaintiffs’
Amended Complaint reveals the fatal flaws in their ERISA claims, including: (1)
Plaintiffs assert an ERISA recordkeeping violation where no private cause of action exists
as a matter of law; (2) Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims challenge only the business practices of
Defendants (failure to pay appropriate wages) and not the administration of a plan to
which ERISA’s recordkeeping and fiduciary standards apply; (3) Plaintiffs assert their
ERISA claims under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA which is not applicable; (4) although
Plaintiffs attempt to disguise their claims as a request for injunctive relief, they are
actually claims for ERISA benefits which must be dismissed for failure to exhaust
administrative plan remedies; and (5) Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims are not ripe for
adjudication.
Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims based on Plaintiffs’
failure to plead standing and employment relationships as to each named Defendant
necessary to assert such claims.

In the interests of judicial economy and brevity,

Defendants adopt and incorporate by reference the arguments and authority demonstrating
Plaintiffs’ failure to properly plead standing and employment relationships included in
their Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings Against Plaintiffs’ FLSA Cause of Action. (Doc. No. 52)

SUMMARY OF PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiffs commenced this action on September 3, 2009. See Complaint, Dkt. # 1

Plaintiffs originally named ten entities as defendants in this action, including seven

2

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 3 of 21

corporations, two individuals, and “UMass Memorial Healthcare 401K”.

Id.

When

Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint on October 11, 2010, Plaintiffs removed the two
individual defendants, thereby naming a total of seven entities as the current named
Defendants. See Am. Compl., Dkt. # 48. In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs do not
specify which of these separate entities actually employed them, nor where they actually
worked. See generally Am. Compl. Instead, Plaintiffs allege in vague and conclusory
terms only that “they were employees under the FLSA” (Id. at ¶ 25), and “defendants are
the employer (single, joint or otherwise) of the Plaintiffs and Class Members and/or alter
egos of each other.” Id. at ¶ 23.
Plaintiffs assert four causes of action against Defendants, but Plaintiffs’ Amended
Complaint focuses on the overarching allegation that, in violation of the FLSA, Plaintiffs “were
suffered or permitted to work by defendants and not paid their regular or statutorily required rate of
pay for all hours worked” during meal breaks, before and after their scheduled work shifts, and while
attending various training programs. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26, 28-96. Using the identical factual
predicate forming the basis for their cause of action under the FLSA (compare Am.
Compl. ¶¶ 68-71 with Am. Compl. ¶¶ 58-60), Plaintiffs attempt to bootstrap causes of
action into the case for alleged violations of ERISA’s recordkeeping provisions, set forth
in ERISA § 209(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1059(a)(1), and ERISA’s fiduciary duty obligations,
set forth in ERISA § 404(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1).

Am. Compl. ¶¶ 99-103.

However, the core of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint remains an alleged failure to
properly pay Plaintiffs wages under the FLSA. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 6 (“The class consists
of current and former employees of defendants whose 401(k) plans were not credited with
their non-reduced weekly wages and correct overtime compensation.”).

Plaintiffs’ Fail To Plead A Sufficient Nexus Between Themselves And The
Various Legal Entities And Plans

Plaintiffs identify only one ERISA-governed plan in their Amended Complaint: the UMass
Memorial Health Care 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”).2 Am. Compl. ¶ 68. UMass Memorial Health Care,
Inc. sponsors the Plan, in which employees of UMass Memorial Health Care, Inc. and various
affiliated entities, including UMass Memorial Medical Center, Inc. but not all named Defendants, are
eligible to participate according to its terms. (A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit A.)3 No
other employer sponsors the Plan. Ex. A, p. 10, § 1.39. Plaintiffs allude to multiple other unnamed
“pension plans” in their Amended Complaint, but fail to identify any of those other “pension plans” by
name. Am. Compl. ¶ 68 (“Defendants sponsor pension plans including the UMass Memorial
Healthcare 401K (the ‘Plan’) for its employees.”). Moreover, Plaintiffs do not specify which of the
eight defendants they name allegedly owe legal duties to the UMass Memorial Health Care 401(k)
Plan, let alone the other unidentified ERISA plans they implicate, or why those defendants who have
such duties should be liable to them under ERISA.
B.

No Duty Under The Plan To “Police” Contributions From Employers

The UMass Memorial Health Care 401(k) Plan specifies that employer contributions will be
made to the Plan based on an eligible participant’s “Compensation,” which is defined as the “total
amount of base pay, overtime pay, shift differentials, annual incentive compensation ... paid to the
Employee by the Employer during the Plan Year...,” as well as a potential matching contribution based
on the participant’s contributions actually made to the Plan. Ex. A, p. 2, § 1.8 (emphasis added); p. 232

Plaintiffs misname the Plan the “UMass Memorial Healthcare 401(k) Plan.”
A copy of the Plan is attached as Exhibit A hereto. Because the Plan is specifically referenced in, and
does not contradict, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, it may be considered for purposes of Defendants’
Motion. See Edes v. Verizon Comm’ns, 417 F. 3d 133, 137 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding in ERISA case
that “where, as here, ‘a complaint's factual allegations are expressly linked to -- and admittedly
dependent upon -- a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document effectively
merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule
12(b)(6).’”); Beddall v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998) (considering
ERISA plan when ruling on motion to dismiss and holding that “[w]hen, as now, a complaint’s factual
allegations are expressly linked to – and admittedly dependent upon – a document (the authenticity of
which is not challenged), that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can
review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).”); Fudge v. Penthouse Int’l, Ltd., 840
F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir. 1988) (same).

25, §§ 5.1, 5.2. The Plan does not provide that employer contributions will be made, or that benefits
under the Plan will be calculated based on compensation that the participant should have received.
Similarly, the Plan does not provide that contributions or benefits will be calculated using hours
actually worked by participants. Rather, the Plan provides that a participant will receive service hour
credit for each hour where the participant is directly or indirectly paid for the performance of job
duties. Ex. A, p. 6, § 1.23. Moreover, the Plan expressly excludes service hour credit for back pay
hours unless an award of back pay is actually made or agreed to by the participant’s employer. Id.
Because the UMass Memorial Health Care 401(k) Plan calculates employer contributions
based on “Compensation” expressly defined as wages actually paid to the employee, there is no duty
under the Plan for any employer, plan sponsor or plan fiduciary to make contributions to the Plan
based on amounts that were not paid to a participant, regardless of the reason. Similarly, because the
Plan defines service hours as hours for which a participant was paid, and expressly excludes back pay
not awarded or agreed to from their definition of hours of service, there is no duty under the Plan for
any employer, plan sponsor or plan fiduciary to make contributions to the Plan based on hours of work
for which the participant was not paid and for which back pay has not been awarded or agreed.

ARGUMENT
A.

Applicable Legal Standard

At any time after the pleadings close and “within such time as not to delay trial,” a party may
move for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(c). Judgment on the pleadings should be granted if the movant “is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.” Burns Int’l Security Servs. v. Int’l Union, 47 F.3d 14, 16 (2d Cir. 1994). Rule 12(c) motions
are analyzed under the standards applied to a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Remexcel
Managerial Consultants, Inc. v. Arlequin, 583 F.3d 45, 49 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009) (“The standard for
evaluating a motion to dismiss is the same as that for a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”).
In considering a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court accepts as true
factual allegations in the complaint.

Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &

Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 163-65 (1993). However, as the Supreme Court recently explained,

5

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 6 of 21

“[w]hile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual
allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more
than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not
do.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65 (2007) (abandoning the “no set of facts”
language of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957) in favor of a “plausibility” standard)
(quotations and citations omitted). Such “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right of relief
above the speculative level,” and Plaintiffs must state “enough facts to state a claim for relief that is
plausible on its face.” Id. at 1965, 1974.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Fail To Plead A Sufficient Nexus Between Themselves And The
Various Legal Entities And Plan

In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs do not specify which of the eight defendants they
name allegedly owe legal duties to the Plan, or why those defendants with such duties should be liable
under ERISA. As this Court recently recognized, relying on the recent decision in Twombly:
to state a claim for benefits under an ERISA plan that is “plausible on its face,”
the plaintiffs must do more than allege that they are employees of the
defendants. While participants in a plan are necessarily employees, it is not the
case that employees are necessarily participants in a plan. ERISA does not
require employers to establish plans at all, nor, if they do, to make the plans
available to all. Consequently, the plaintiffs must set forth sufficient factual
allegations to make plausible a conclusion that they fall within the terms of a
particular ERISA plan and, thus, are entitled to seek to enforce those terms
under § 1132(a)(1)(B).
Curran v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 593 F. Supp. 2d 341, 344 (D. Mass. 2009) (internal citations
omitted)(emphasis added).
Here, Plaintiffs broadly assert ERISA claims against eight separate legal entities. However,
Plaintiffs do not even attempt to set forth allegations upon which the Court could plausibly conclude
that any defendant is a fiduciary or administrator of any ERISA-governed plan.4 Plaintiffs offer no

Further, it is clear that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead a claim for relief under ERISA as to
the unnamed other pension plans implicitly referenced in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. See Am.
Compl. ¶ 68 (“Defendants sponsor pension plans including the UMass Memorial Healthcare 401K (the
‘Plan’) for its employees.”). It is axiomatic that, to maintain a claim for improperly denied benefits

6

allegations concerning which defendants (if any) sponsor the alleged plan(s) at issue, which
defendants (if any) are charged with administering the alleged plan(s) at issue, or which defendants (if
any) allegedly breached an ERISA-mandated duty. Plaintiffs failure to allege any plausible facts on
which the Court could conclude that any defendant owes a legal duty to Plaintiffs under ERISA makes
Plaintiffs’ claims subject to immediate dismissal. Id.; Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1974.
C.

Cause Of Action II, Alleging A Violation Of ERISA § 209(a)(1), Fails To
State A Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted

In Cause of Action II, Plaintiffs assert a claim for alleged violations of ERISA’s
recordkeeping provisions, set forth in ERISA § 209(a)(1). Plaintiffs base this claim on
Defendants’ alleged failure to record uncompensated working time and use this time when calculating
contributions to the Plan. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 99-101. According to Plaintiffs, “defendants’ records are
legally insufficient to determine benefits.” Am. Compl. ¶ 70.
1.

Cause Of Action II Fails As A Matter Of Law Because Plaintiffs Have
No Private Right To Bring An ERISA Recordkeeping Claim

Cause of Action II of the Amended Complaint fails because ERISA § 209(a)(1) does not
provide Plaintiffs a private cause of action. ERISA § 209(a)(1) provides in relevant part:
(a)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (2) every employer shall, in accordance
with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary, maintain records with respect
to each of his employees sufficient to determine the benefits due or which may
become due to such employees.
***
(b) If any person who is required under subsection (a) of this section to furnish
information or maintain records for any plan year fails to comply with such
requirements, he shall pay to the Secretary a civil penalty of $10 for each
employee with respect to whom such failure occurs, unless it is shown that
such failure is due to reasonable cause.
29 U.S.C. § 1059(a)(1); (b) (emphasis added).

under ERISA, a plaintiff must first allege facts confirming the existence of an ERISA-governed plan.
See, e.g., Donovan v. Dillingham, 688 F.2d 1367, 1373 (11th Cir. 1982) (en banc); Tevini v. CHC
Int’l, Inc., 946 F. Supp. 985, 987 (S.D. Fla. 1996) (“To establish federal jurisdiction, the complaint
must allege facts as will show the establishment or maintenance of a ‘plan, fund or program’ of the
type covered by ERISA.”). Plaintiffs have alleged no such facts with regard to the unnamed “other”
pension plans.

“Undeniably, [ERISA § 209(a)(1)] obligates an employer to maintain certain time records; it
is also undeniable that [ERISA § 209(a)(1)] does not provide a private cause of action for affected
employees.” Premick v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc., No. 02:06cv0530, 2007 WL 141913, at *6
(W.D. Pa., Jan. 18, 2007).5 Accordingly, Cause of Action II of the Amended Complaint, which
purports to state a claim under ERISA § 209(a)(1), should be dismissed.
2.

Defendants Were Not Acting As Plan Fiduciaries When They Engaged
In The Conduct At Issue

Plaintiffs’ assertion in Cause of Action II that various legal entities failed to keep accurate
records due to an employment function – allegedly failing to record uncompensated working time –
does not implicate ERISA’s fiduciary functions in administering the plans. “Under ERISA, a
fiduciary is defined functionally: a party is a fiduciary ‘to the extent’ that he or she exercises discretion
over the management of the plans or its funds or over its administration.” Livick v. Gillette Co., 524
F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A)); see also Beddall, 137 F. 3d at 18
(“fiduciary status is not an all or nothing proposition: the statutory language indicates that a person is a
plan fiduciary only ‘to the extent’ that he possesses or exercises the requisite discretion and control.”).
Accordingly, “in cases alleging breach of ERISA fiduciary duty, the threshold question is not whether
the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan
beneficiary’s interest...but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a
fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.” Livick, 524 F.3d at 29 (citing
Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 226 (2000)); see also Solis v. Plan Benefit Servs. Inc., 620 F. Supp.
2d 131, 143 (D. Mass. 2009) (“a person can be a fiduciary with respect to certain functions involving
an ERISA plan, and not be a fiduciary with respect to other functions”).
In the present case, Plaintiffs’ ERISA recordkeeping claim fails because Defendants were not
acting as Plan fiduciaries or performing a fiduciary function when they engaged in the conduct at

Systems Employees’ Retirement Plan, 335 F. Supp. 2d 590, 606 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (same); Lowe’s v.

issue. Plaintiffs are challenging an alleged non-fiduciary business determination by Defendants not to
pay Plaintiffs for alleged uncompensated working time. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26, 28, 58, 70. Plaintiffs
do not allege that Defendants generally failed to keep records in violation of ERISA § 209(a)(1).
Rather, Plaintiffs allege that the records Defendants do keep are inaccurate because they failed to
record the alleged uncompensated working time. See Am. Compl. ¶ 70 (“Defendants failed to keep
accurate records of all time worked by Class Members.”) (emphasis added). While this business
decision, as alleged by Plaintiffs, could have indirectly impacted the administration of the Plan at
issue, Plaintiffs’ artful pleading cannot morph their claim into something it is not: a claim challenging
the administration of the Plan. Where, as here, Plaintiffs quarrel with a non-fiduciary business decision
which may have impacted the records on which ERISA benefit determinations were made, rather than
the maintenance of those records themselves, they fail to state a claim under ERISA and their cause of
action must be dismissed. See, e.g., Livick, 524 F.3d at 29 (dismissing ERISA claim where plaintiff
challenged the impact of non-fiduciary ministerial functions on the determination of plan benefits);
On this point, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida’s recent opinion in Zipp v.
World Mortgage Co., Case No. 6:08-cv-1638 (M.D. Fla. June 26, 2009) (attached hereto as Exhibit
B), is instructive. As in the present case, Zipp involved ERISA recordkeeping and breach of fiduciary
duty claims. Engaging in a comprehensive analysis of competing authority addressing “whether
viable ERISA claims are stated where the underlying act at issue is the failure to pay overtime,” the
court concluded that “the decisions favoring the Defendants’ position are the better reasoned,” and
dismissed both ERISA claims. Id. at 5, 12. In doing so, the District Court expressly noted that “with
regard to the recordkeeping claim, Plaintiff Walker does not allege that Defendants failed to keep
records as required by ERISA; he argues in essence that the records that were kept are incorrect due to
the classification decision. Again, that underlying decision is an employment decision, not an ERISA
Plan decision.” Id. at 12-13. In the present case, just as in Zipp, Plaintiffs are challenging an
employment decision made by Defendants, not Defendants’ administration of an ERISA plan. As in
Zipp, Plaintiffs’ “ERISA [recordkeeping] claims are not legally cognizable” and “fail to state
actionable claims.” Id.

Cause Of Action III, Alleging Breach of Fiduciary Duty Under ERISA,
Fails As A Matter Of Law Because There Is No Fiduciary Duty To
“Police” Employers’ Contributions To The Plans

In Cause of Action III, Plaintiffs assert a claim for an alleged breach of ERISA’s
fiduciary duty obligations, set forth in ERISA § 404(a)(1). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 102-103.
According to Plaintiffs, Defendants violated fiduciary duties under ERISA by failing to “police”
their employer and make sure the employer was properly paying the Plaintiffs for all
compensable working time so that, by default, Plaintiffs and the putative class would
receive the correct contributions to their 401(k) plan accounts. Am. Compl. ¶ 71.
1.

No Breach Of Fiduciary Duties Exists Because Defendants
Administered The Plan In Accordance With Its Express And
Unambiguous Terms

ERISA § 404(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(1)(D), specifies that an ERISA fiduciary is required to
discharge its duties “in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan[.]” “When
ERISA plans contain unambiguous language, the Court construes them according to their ‘plain and
natural meaning.’” Santana, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 176 (citing Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability
Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir. 1989)). Further, under the UMass Memorial Health Care 401(k) Plan,
fiduciaries acting as administrators of the Plan have discretionary authority to enforce, construe, and
apply the terms of the Plan. See Ex. A, p. 59-60, §§ 11.1, 11.2; p. 65, § 11.9. Accordingly, to the
extent any of Defendants were acting as a fiduciary of the Plan, the defendant’s decisions with regard
to the administration of the Plan are not to be disturbed if they are reasonable, regardless of whether
they are the best interpretation possible. See Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, 566
F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2009) (“where the plan documents delegate discretionary authority to the plan
administrator (whether or not structurally conflicted), courts should review benefit-denial decisions for
abuse of discretion”); Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2002) (“In an ERISA
benefit denial case, trial is usually not an option: in a very real sense, the district court sits more as an
appellate tribunal than as a trial court. ...it evaluates the reasonableness of an administrative
determination in light of the record compiled before the plan fiduciary.”).
As set forth above, the Plan defines “Compensation,” a factor upon which employer

10

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 11 of 21

contributions are to be made on behalf of participants, to be only wages actually paid to the employee.
See Ex. A, p. 2, § 1.8; p. 23-25, §§ 5.1, 5.2. Accordingly, by the plain meaning of the Plan, there is no
duty for any employer, plan sponsor or plan fiduciary to make contributions to the Plan based on
amounts that were not actually paid to a participant. Similarly, the Plan defines service hours as hours
for which a participant was paid, and expressly excludes back pay not awarded or agreed to from their
definition of hours of service. Ex. A, p. 6, § 1.23.6 Thus, there is no duty under the Plan for any
employer, plan sponsor or plan fiduciary to make contributions to the Plan based on hours of work for
which the participant was not paid.
Once again, the District Court’s opinion in Zipp is instructive.

Assessing a

virtually identical breach of ERISA fiduciary duty claim, the Court found that “with
regard to crediting compensation, the terms of the WISE Plan define compensation as
‘amounts paid by an Employer to an Employee,’ not amounts earned; thus, by crediting
the Plan based on actual compensation paid—which is what Plaintiff Walker alleges
Defendants did—Defendants were acting in accordance with the Plan terms.” Slip. op. at
13; see also Maranda v. Group Health Plan, Inc., Case No. 07-4655 DSD/SRN, 2008 WL 2139584,
at **1-2 (D. Minn. May 20, 2008) (dismissing fiduciary breach claim because the defendant “had no
obligation to make contributions based on overtime hours for which plaintiffs received no
compensation and was indeed following the terms of the Plan when it did not make such
contributions”). The same is true in the present case: Defendant UMass Memorial Health Care,
Inc. has administered the Plan according to its express terms. Accordingly, Defendants have not
6

The terms of the Plan defining “Hour of Service” state in full that an hour of service includes “[e]ach
hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance
of duties for the Employer or an Affiliated Employer during a plan year.” Ex. A, p. 6, § 1.23(a).
Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint asserts that Defendants did not pay Plaintiffs for the alleged hours of
work in question. Defendants dispute Plaintiffs’ entitlement to compensation for any such alleged
hours of work. Thus, those alleged hours of work do not fall within the Plan’s definition of “Hour of
Service.” Further, the fact that Plaintiffs have instituted a proceeding for back payment for the alleged
hours of work makes it even more clear that the Plan does not require Defendants to credit Plaintiffs
with hours of service for these disputed alleged unpaid work hours. The Plan makes it expressly clear
that such “back pay hours” will not be considered hours of service unless the back pay “is either
awarded or agreed to by the Employer or an Affiliated Employer.” Ex. A, p. 6, § 1.23(c).

breached any fiduciary duties under ERISA and Count III of Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails.
Nor can Plaintiffs escape this determination by asking the Court to expand the definitions of
“Compensation” and “Hours of Service” found in the Plan to include the back pay to which they now
claim they are entitled under the FLSA. The law does not allow Plaintiffs to substitute their judgment
regarding an interpretation of the terms of the Plan in place of the reasonable interpretation of
Defendants. See Bremer v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 16 F. Supp. 2d 1057, 1060 (D. Minn.
1997) (“As long as a reasonable explanation is offered by the Plan administrator, [its] decision should
not be disturbed even if another reasonable, but different, interpretation may be made.”) (citations
omitted). Instead, the law requires Defendants to follow the unambiguous terms of the Plan, which is
exactly what Defendant UMass Memorial Health Care, Inc. has done. See ERISA § 404(1)(D).7
2.

Cause Of Action III Fails Because It Challenges An Employer’s
Business Decisions Not Subject To ERISA’s Fiduciary Standards

Moreover, even if Plaintiffs could put forth a viable argument that one or more defendants,
acting as plan fiduciary of the Plan, violated the terms of the Plan when failing to make contributions
for uncompensated working time, Plaintiffs still fail to assert a legally cognizable claim under ERISA.
According to Plaintiffs, unspecified defendants violated fiduciary duties under ERISA by failing to
“police” their employer to make sure they were properly paying the Plaintiffs for all
compensable working time.

Am. Compl. ¶ 71.

Plaintiffs do not claim that these

fiduciaries made an error in calculation or misinterpreted the terms of an ERISA plan,
instead, Plaintiffs quarrel with business decisions of their employers (i.e., not paying
Plaintiffs’ for the alleged uncompensated working time) which allegedly resulted in
improper factors (i.e., a lower contribution level and a lower credited hours of service)
being used in otherwise proper plan administration.
7

Even assuming an arguable breach of fiduciary duty occurred (which it did not) and Plaintiffs did
have a private right of action for their ERISA recordkeeping claim (which they do not), as shown in
Section III(F) below, Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims still fail because they are not ripe. The Plan expressly
excludes back pay awards from Hours of Service unless and until a back pay award is paid or the
employer agrees to such an award, and no such award has been paid or agreed to in this case.

Once again it is apparent that Plaintiffs are not challenging a fiduciary action under ERISA,
instead, Plaintiffs are challenging a business decision by their employers not to pay them for overtime.
In such cases courts have widely and wisely recognized that an employer’s decision not to pay
plaintiffs for overtime or alleged compensable working time is not subject to ERISA’s fiduciary
standards. For example, in LePage v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota, Case No 08-584
(RHK/JSM), 2008 WL 2570815 (D. Minn. June 25, 2008), the court also examined ERISA claims
stemming from alleged FLSA overtime violations. Concluding the failure to pay overtime was not
subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards, the District Court soundly reasoned that “[a]n employers’
discretion in determining compensation is a business judgment which does not involve the
administration of an ERISA plan or the investment of an ERISA plan’s assets. Such a decision may
ultimately affect a plan indirectly, but it does not implicate fiduciary concerns regarding plan
administration or assets notwithstanding the decision’s collateral effect on prospective, contingent
employee benefits.” Id. at *5-6; see also Ballaris v. Wacker Siltronic Corp., Case No. 00-1627, 2002
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2746, at *2 (D. Or. Feb. 7, 2002) (employer’s “decision concerning whether to pay
wages for changing time has only an extremely indirect connection to the administration of the ERISA
plan” and employer “was not acting as an ERISA fiduciary in this regard”).
Moreover, in LePage, the District Court was cognizant of the fact that the plan at issue defined
eligible earnings as compensation actually paid to a participant, not compensation that should have
been paid. Id.

Thus, the Court held that the employer did not have a fiduciary duty to credit

employees’ 401(K) plans for overtime or wages that were not actually paid to the employees and there
were no records to correct when it did not make contributions based upon overtime hours for which
the plaintiffs received no compensation. Id. The employer’s decision not to pay Plaintiffs’ overtime
did not pertain to the administration of the 401(k) Plan; rather, it was a business decision to which
ERISA’s fiduciary standards did not apply regardless of whether it may have impacted plaintiffs’
benefits under the plan. Id. Consequently, “Plaintiffs have failed to state a legally cognizable claim
with respect to the retirement plan at issue.” Id.

Filed 11/19/10 Page 14 of 21

The District Court’s reasoning in LePage is directly applicable to Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs
challenge an alleged business decision not to pay them for uncompensated working time which does
not pertain to the administration of the Plan. Thus, ERISA’s fiduciary duty standards are inapplicable
and Plaintiffs do not assert a valid claim under ERISA. Indeed, a flood of courts have expressly
rejected identical ERISA claims asserted by Plaintiff’s counsel on this very basis. See Barrus v. Dick's
Sporting Goods, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79014, **36-37 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2010) (“[t]he Court
determines that Plaintiffs’ allegations fail to support a plausible claim that Defendants were acting as
fiduciaries when they allegedly failed to report all hours of service. In determining the wage policy,
Defendants were not acting as plan fiduciaries, and the Court finds unpersuasive the allegation that
Defendants had a legal duty as ERISA fiduciaries to investigate crediting overtime pay.”); Kuznyetsov
v. West Penn Allegheny Health Sys., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12999, ** (W.D. Pa., Feb. 16, 2010)
(“the plan documents in this case tie ERISA benefits to compensation paid and not to hours worked.
Therefore, Defendants in our case, as in Henderson, Camesi, and Mathews, violated neither their
recording nor fiduciary duties under ERISA because those obligations related to ‘Compensation’ that
was paid, not hours allegedly worked by Plaintiffs but not paid.”) Moreover, in LePage, the court
recognized the devastating policy considerations implicated if Plaintiffs’ logic were allowed to support
the specious ERISA claims they assert, finding that “[s]uch a far-reaching duty would send the
administration of the plan into gridlock and dramatically increase the cost of administering the plan.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly warned that Congress did not intend that ERISA be ‘a system that
is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from
offering...benefit plans in the first place.’” 2008 WL 2570815 at *7 (internal citations omitted).
Similarly, if this Court were to accept Plaintiffs’ logic that a plan fiduciary’s failure to police
plan sponsors to ensure that plan participants did not have any claim to additional compensation could
subject the fiduciary to legal liability for improper plan contributions, administration of the Plan would
be sent into a tailspin. As the Plan sponsor, UMass Memorial Health Care, Inc., on behalf of the Plan,
would have to employ an army of lawyers equal or larger in size to the current payroll departments of
the participating entities to conduct constant audits of an employer’s compensation practices and

14

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 15 of 21

payroll determinations to ensure that no participant could challenge them. Failure to do so would
result in massive potential liability and prohibitive legal costs.

In other words, the costs of

administering the Plan would far exceed its benefits, and UMass Memorial Health Care, Inc. would
have absolutely no incentive to maintain the Plan. As the District Court noted in LePage, such a result
is fundamentally at odds with ERISA, which further exposes the fact that Plaintiffs’ claims are not
legally cognizable under ERISA. Id.; see also Steavens v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 2008 WL
3540070, at **4-5 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 12, 2008) (same).

Plaintiffs’ ERISA Claims Should Be Dismissed With Prejudice Because
Plaintiffs Cannot Bring Denial Of Benefit Claims Under ERISA §
502(a)(3) And Plaintiffs Failed To Exhaust Administrative Remedies
1.

ERISA § 502(a)(3) Does Not Provide A Right To Relief For The
Violations Of ERISA Alleged By Plaintiffs

Plaintiffs’ impermissibly seek benefits as damages in Causes of Action II and III through
ERISA § 502(a)(3), ERISA’s injunctive enforcement mechanism, which is not available here.
Accordingly, Causes of Action II and III should be dismissed with prejudice.
“The six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in section 502(a) of [ERISA]
provide strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot
to incorporate expressly.” Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 146-47 (1985). ERISA’s
civil enforcement provisions are “carefully integrated” because they provide different causes of action
based on the nature of relief sought. Claims for benefits under ERISA are governed by 29 U.S.C. §
1132(a)(1)(B) (“ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B)”), permitting a plan participant “to recover benefits due to him
under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to
future benefits under the terms of the plan.” In contrast, ERISA § 502(a)(3) – ERISA’s “catch-all”
equitable provision – provides in relevant part that a civil action may be brought:
(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice
which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B)
to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii)
to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).

15

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 16 of 21

The relief available under ERISA § 502(a)(3), however, is extremely limited. See generally,
Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248 (1993); Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534
U.S. 204 (2002). “Money damages..., the classic form of legal relief” is not available under the catchall provision. Mertens, 508 U.S. at 255; Great-West, 534 U.S. at 210. Accordingly, the Supreme
Court has opined that equitable relief under ERISA § 502(a)(3) is only “appropriate” if there is no
remedy under ERISA’s other civil enforcement provisions. Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 515
(1996) (“[W]here Congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary’s injury, there will
likely be no need for further equitable relief in which case such relief normally would not be
‘appropriate.’”); Tuohig v. Principal Ins. Group, 134 F. Supp. 2d 148, 151 (D. Mass. 2001) (same).
Here, to redress their alleged ERISA recordkeeping violation in Cause of Action II,
Plaintiffs purport to seek injunctive relief under ERISA § 502(a)(3) “to enjoin any violation of
ERISA § 1059(a)(1).” Am. Compl. ¶ 100. However, nowhere in their Amended Complaint
do Plaintiffs explain why injunctive relief is appropriate to redress this alleged ERISA
violation, nor do they explain the nature of the injunctive relief they seek. Even further,
Cause of Action III in the Amended Complaint, raising a claim for breach of ERISA’s
fiduciary standards, does not specify at all under which enforcement mechanism of
ERISA Plaintiffs purport to bring their claim.
Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions otherwise, Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief makes it plain that for
both ERISA causes of action Plaintiffs are seeking recovery of “an award of the value of Plaintiffs’
and Class Members [sic] unpaid wages, including fringe benefits.” Am. Compl., ¶ “WHEREFORE,”
p. 16 (emphasis added); see also Am. Compl. ¶ 6 (“The class consists of current and former
employees of defendants whose 401(k) plans were not credited with their non-reduced
weekly wages and correct overtime compensation.”).

Courts examining causes of action

virtually identical to those asserted by Plaintiffs have reached a similar conclusion. See, e.g., Premick,
2007 WL 14191 at *6 (“Upon close examination of the Complaint, it is clear that in Count III
[alleging violation of ERISA § 209(a)(1)] Premick is asserting a claim for benefits he claims to be
owed because his 401(k) account was allegedly shorted as a result of Dick’s failure to pay him certain

16

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 17 of 21

amounts of overtime to which he contends entitlement.”).
The injunctive relief provided for in ERISA § 502(a)(3) is not available for a claim for
benefits under ERISA. See Varity Corp., 516 U.S. at 515; accord Wald v. Southwestern Bell Corp.
Customcare Med. Plan, 83 F.3d 1002, 1005 (8th Cir. 1996) (“Because Wald is provided adequate
relief by her right to bring a claim for benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B), . . . she does not have a
cause of action under section 502(a)(3).”); Premick, 2007 WL 141913 at *6 (“[A] claim for benefits
can only be brought under [ERISA § 503(a)(1)(B)] and is not a claim for injunctive relief, but rather
one for damages.”) (citations omitted). Because Plaintiffs are impermissibly seeking to enforce a claim
for plan benefits through the wrong ERISA enforcement mechanism, Causes of Action II and III
should be dismissed. See Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., 141 F. Supp. 2d 145, 150 (D. Mass.
2001) (“Deaconess correctly asserts that Watson’s use of the work “enjoin” in his prayer for relief
cannot transform an action for money damages into an equitable proceeding.”).
Any argument by Plaintiffs that they are not, in actuality, seeking damages for benefits to
which they are allegedly entitled is belied by the very fact that they seek to represent a large class of
individuals who would not benefit from injunctive relief. As noted by this very Court only a short
while ago, plaintiffs who seek to represent individuals in a class proceeding to redress alleged
violations of ERISA would be ill-served by proceeding under ERISA § 502(a)(3), which provides
only for equitable relief. See generally, Mogel v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
74220 (D. Mass. Aug. 19, 2009). As stated by the Court:
...it is unclear how the class members, defined as those beneficiaries who were
paid benefits through Security Account, would benefit at all from the
injunctive relief sought. Although they have suffered harm in the past from
UNUM’s alleged violations of ERISA, the only individuals likely to face
further harm from UNUM’s practices are those who, coincidentally, are the
beneficiary of another UNUM policy. ...under the framework for weighing
predominance followed by other circuits, it is clear that Plaintiffs’ “primary
objective” is monetary relief. ...absent the prospect of monetary recovery, the
named plaintiffs and class members have no incentive to pursue their claims.
Id. at **14-16. In the present case, just as in Mogel, Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of more than
13,000 individuals comprised of “current and former employees” of Defendant over a multi-year

17

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 54

Filed 11/19/10 Page 18 of 21

limitations period. Am. Compl. ¶ 6-7 (emphasis added). For the large number of individuals within
Plaintiff’s broad putative class who no longer are employed with Defendant and no longer receiving
employer contributions to their accounts in the plans at issue, injunctive relief would provide them no
relief at all. This includes Plaintiff Cavallaro herself, who is no longer an employee of Defendant.
Surely Plaintiffs and their counsel are not willing to exclude this large portion of the putative class,
including Plaintiff Cavallaro, from any recovery for their alleged violations of ERISA. Accordingly,
in any light, Plaintiffs’ ERISA causes of action seek recovery of plan benefits and their claims are
inappropriately brought under ERISA § 502(a)(3).
2.

Plaintiffs Failed To Exhaust Administrative Remedies

In accordance with the provisions of 29 U.S.C. § 1133(2), the UMass Memorial Health Care
401(k) Plan provides an extensive review procedure for participants to use when they believe that they
have improperly been denied Plan benefits. See Ex. A, p. 60-62, § 11.4. Plaintiffs have not alleged
that they complied with these claims procedures, nor have they alleged that complying with these
claims procedures would be futile. Having failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, Plaintiffs
cannot state a claim for benefits under ERISA § 503(a)(1)(b). See Drinkwater v. Met. Life Ins. Co.,
846 F.2d 821, 825-26 (1st Cir. 1988) (dismissing ERISA benefits claim for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies and noting exhaustion doctrine would be “rendered meaningless” if plaintiffs
were allowed to bypass exhaustion by artfully dressing benefit claims in breach of fiduciary duty
language); Santana v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 12 F. Supp. 2d 162 (D. Mass. 1998) (“This
Court agrees...that strong public policy reasons—most prominently to render meaningful the
Congressional mandate that all ERISA plans include an appeal process—compel plaintiffs to exhaust
all benefit denial claims, regardless of their nature.”). Further, any attempt by Plaintiffs to amend their
Amended Complaint to state a claim under ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B) would be futile as a matter of law.
Plaintiffs’ claims would be subject to immediate dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative
remedies. Accordingly, dismissal of Causes of Action II and III should be with prejudice.

Even if Plaintiffs Could Assert A Cause Of Action Under ERISA, Their
Claims Still Fail As A Matter Of Law Because They Are Not Ripe

Even assuming Plaintiffs could state a claim for violation of ERISA, Causes of Action II and
III should nevertheless be dismissed because they are not ripe. The Secretary of Labor has
promulgated regulations defining how plan administrators should calculate hours of work for purposes
of ERISA in instances where, as here, plan participants seek back pay from their employers: “[a]n
hour of service is each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either
awarded or agreed to by the employer” 29 C.F.R. § 2530.200b-2(a)(3) (emphasis supplied). Similarly,
by its express terms the Plan expressly excludes back pay hours from the plan’s definition of “Hours
of Service” unless the participant (1) actually receives an award of back pay or (2) the participant’s
employer agrees to the award of back pay. Ex. A, p. 6, § 1.23. Then – and only then – will these
alleged “off-the-clock” hours of work constitute “hours of service” for purposes of ERISA, thus
triggering a plan fiduciary’s obligation to credit such hours to the Plan for the appropriate period(s).
Neither condition precedent to a plan fiduciary’s obligation under ERISA to credit the Plan for
Plaintiffs’ alleged “off-the-clock” hours of work have been met. Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims will
become ripe if – and only if – they obtain an award of back pay against Defendants, or Defendants
agree to pay them back pay, and the plan fiduciaries, after being afforded an opportunity to credit the
Plan accordingly, refuse to do so. See, e.g., Gun Owners’ Action League v. Swift, 284 F.3d 198, 20506 (1st Cir. 2003) (“In determining ripeness, we apply a familiar test: the question in each case is
whether there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient
immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.”) (internal citations omitted).
Until such time, Plaintiffs’ ERISA claims fail as a matter of law and should be dismissed.
IV.

CONCLUSION
As noted above, Defendants’ Motion For Judgment On The Pleadings Against Plaintiffs’

ERISA Causes of Action II and III of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint should be granted.
