PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS AGAINST PLAINTIFFS’ ERISA
CAUSES OF ACTION
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Defendants’ motion, which is held to the same standard as a motion to dismiss, should
plainly be denied.

Plaintiffs have set forth allegations sufficient to plausibly suggest that

defendants violated their fiduciary and record keeping duties as administrators of plans subject to
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). Indeed, numerous courts have held
that that an employer’s failure to properly credit employees for all hours worked—as a necessary
task for purposes of benefit calculation—constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.
Because plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they were employed by defendants and subject to
identified ERISA plan(s), defendants’ motion should be denied.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On September 3, 2009, plaintiffs Patricia Cavallaro and Monique Herman, and all other
similarly situated employees (“plaintiffs”) commenced this action against UMass Memorial
Health Care, Inc., and the other named defendants (collectively “defendants”) for defendants’
violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), ERISA, and the Racketeering Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) arising from defendants’ illegal pay policies and
practices.
Specifically, plaintiffs’ Causes of Action II and III alleged violations of ERISA against
defendants as sponsors of employee benefits plans as follows:
•

By failing to keep records of all time worked by Class Members, defendants’ records are
legally insufficient to determine benefits owed to employees who are plan participants
(See Second Amended Complaint (“Amend. Compl.”) ¶¶ 119-120);1 and

•

While acting as fiduciaries exercising discretion over the administration of the plan,
defendants’ failure to credit or even investigate crediting overtime pay as compensation
used to determine benefits under the plan was a breach of defendants’ fiduciary duty
because crediting hours is a fiduciary function, independent of the payment of wages (See
Amend. Compl. ¶121).
Shortly after the dismissal of plaintiffs’ RICO claim, the parties agreed to attempt to

resolve this case through mediation, which was held on September 27, 2010. However, the
parties were at an impasse and resolution was unsuccessful. In conjunction with the mediation,
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to remove the two individual defendants. Now that the
mediation has proved unsuccessful, however, and pursuant to the parties’ Mediation Agreement,
plaintiffs have moved for leave to file a second amended complaint reinstating the claims against
the individual defendants. In the meantime, defendants filed the instant motion for judgment on

As set forth more fully in plaintiffs’ response to defendants first motion for judgment on the pleadings
(FLSA claims), pursuant to the parties’ agreement, plaintiffs have now filed a motion for leave to amend
the complaint to reinstate the claims against the individual defendants. This response is written based on
the allegations in plaintiffs proposed Second Amended Complaint and all complaint references herein are
to that Second Amended Complaint.

the pleadings as to plaintiffs ERISA causes of action (“defendants’ Motion”). They have also
filed a separate motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffs FLSA cause of action.
ARGUMENT
At the outset, defendants have argued that plaintiffs ERISA claims should be dismissed
based on a failure to sufficiently plead standing. In support of that argument, defendants have
incorporated their arguments from their memorandum of law in support of their motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffs’ FLSA claims.

In opposition, plaintiffs hereby

incorporate their arguments asserted in their simultaneously filed memorandum of law in
opposition to defendants’ FLSA dismissal motion.
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
As defendants acknowledge, a motion for judgment on the pleadings is measured by the

same standard as a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6). See Remexcel Managerial Consultants, Inc.
v. Arlequin, 583 F.3d 45, 49 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing Citibank Global Mkts., Inc. v. Santana,
573 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 2009)). Under that standard, “defendants have the burden of showing
that the plaintiffs' claims are insufficient as a matter of law.” E.g., Nat’l Educ. Ass’n-R.I. v.
Retirement Board of R.I. Employees’ Retirement Sys., 890 F. Supp. 1143, 1150 (D.R.I. 1995).
This Court has called that burden “a heavy one.” Stein v. Smith, 270 F. Supp. 2d 157, 164 (D.
Mass. 2003) (Lindsay, J.). A complaint need only contain sufficient factual matter to “state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009).
Indeed, even after Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007), the
requirement is still notice pleading and as defendants correctly note, a complaint does not require
detailed factual allegations. See Moreales-Tanon v. The Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth., 524
F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. Apr. 17, 2008).

Furthermore, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, all

-3-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 4 of 16

allegations of material fact in the complaint are taken as true and viewed in the light most
favorable to the plaintiffs. See Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440, 442-43 (1st Cir. 1992).
Here, plaintiffs have provided detailed allegations of defendants’ breach of fiduciary
duties and the resulting failure to maintain accurate records. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that
these duties were breached by defendants’ failure to credit them with all of the hours of service
they were entitled to be paid. Thus, plaintiffs provide more than sufficient detail of their claims
arising under ERISA, which, if proven, would entitle the plaintiffs to the relief they seek.
Therefore the defendants’ motion should be denied.
II.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGED THE EXISTENCE OF
ERISA PLANS PURSUANT TO WHICH DEFENDANTS HAVE FIDUCIARY
OBLIGATIONS
As an initial matter, courts have established that the inquiry into whether or not a

defendant has a fiduciary duty under an ERISA plan is primarily based upon the facts of the case,
and accordingly, is inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss because no discovery on
such factual issues has yet taken place. Rosenburg v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp., No. C 06-0430
PJH, 2006 WL 1627108 at *3-5 (N.D. Cal. June 12, 2006) (whether an employer has a fiduciary
duty under ERISA to properly pay is a primarily factual issue and such inquiry is “therefore
inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss”).
Nevertheless, plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to conclude that defendants owe
fiduciary obligations under ERISA. To be sure, courts have held that an employer’s failure to
properly credit employees for all hours worked—as a necessary task for purposes of benefit
calculation—constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. See Stickle v. SCI W. Mkt.
Support Ctr., L.P., No. CV 08-083-PHX-MHM, 2008 WL 4446539, at *19 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30,
2008) (“[u]nder ERISA, crediting hours is a fiduciary function, independent of the payment of

wages”); In re Farmers Ins. Exchange Claims Representatives’ Overtime Pay Litigation, No.
MDL No. 33-1439(B), 2005 WL 1972565, at *5 (D. Or. Aug. 15, 2005) (holding that crediting
hours is a fiduciary duty under ERISA and denying defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’
breach of fiduciary duty cause of action); see generally Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 498
(1996) (demonstrating circumstances where employer acting as fiduciary).
Plaintiffs’ amended complaint clearly sets forth allegations supporting the inference that
defendants have fiduciary obligations under an ERISA plan. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 37, 4043, 60, 63-66, 74, 118-121. Accordingly, because plaintiffs sufficiently allege the legal duty that
defendants owe to plaintiffs for the breach of fiduciary duty, plaintiffs’ claims should not be
dismissed.
III.

PLAINTIFFS’ RECORDKEEPING AND BREACH OF FIDUCIARY CLAIMS
ARE NOT BASED ON NON-FIDUCIARY BUSINESS DECISIONS
Defendants argue that the inaccurate timekeeping records are part of a conscious

“business decision” to not pay employees for all the time worked and can therefore not constitute
an ERISA violation for failure to keep accurate records. Defendants also argue that they cannot
be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA because crediting hours is not a
fiduciary function under ERISA. Both arguments fail, however, because as noted above, an
employer’s failure to properly credit employees for all hours worked—as a necessary task for
purposes of benefit calculation—constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.
As the court in Stickle correctly held, crediting hours is a necessary function to be
performed by the Plan fiduciary in order “to determine participants’ participation, vesting and
accrual of rights.” See Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539, at *19 (citing Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517
U.S. 882, 890 (1996). “As such, it is subject to ERISA’s strict fiduciary standards.” Id.

In reaching its decision, the Stickle court considered and rejected Ballaris v. Wacker
Siltronic Corp., 2002 WL 926272 (D. Or. Feb. 7, 2002), a case relied on by defendants here.
The Stickle court rejected Ballaris because there, “the employer’s decision concerning whether
to pay wages for time employees spent preparing to work had ‘only an extremely indirect
connection to the administration of the ERISA plan[.]’” See Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539, at *18
(quoting Ballaris, 2002 WL 926272 at *2). The Stickle court also distinguished Veliz v. Cintas
Corp., No. C 03-1180 SBA, 2003 WL 23857822 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 4, 2003). Veliz involved “the
decision of whether to characterize plaintiffs as non-hourly employees, rather than hourly
employees, and thereby not keep record of plaintiffs’ hours worked.” Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539,
at *18. The Stickle court agreed that such a decision could constitute a business decision not
subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards, but noted that the question before it was not whether the
decision to classify employees as exempt constituted a breach of fiduciary duties, but whether a
plan administrator had breached its fiduciary duty to accurately credit hourly employees for all
hours worked. The same question is at issue here.
Defendants rely on cases that, like Veliz, involved the misclassification of employees.
Those cases should similarly be rejected here. For example, defendants rely heavily on LePage v.
Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minn., No. 08-584, 2008 WL 2570815 (D. Minn. June 25, 2008).
LePage involves the misclassification of employees (LePage, 2008 WL 2570815, at *7) and, as
reasoned in Stickle, is unpersuasive here. Defendants also rely on Zipp v. World Mortgage Co.,
632 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (M.D. Fla. 2009) and Steavens v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., No. 07-14536,
2008 WL 3540070, *5-6 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 12, 2008). Those cases also involve misclassification
of employees and are therefore inapposite. See Zipp, 632 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (holding that “the
business decision whether to classify employees as ‘exempt’ or ‘nonexempt’ for FLSA overtime

-6-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 7 of 16

purposes...does not render the claims based on that classification decision ERISA claims”);
Steavens, 2008 WL 3540070, *5-6 (holding that the decision to pay employees on a salary basis
was a business decision, and that a Plan administrator could not be expected to “investigate”
such decisions as part of its fiduciary duty).
Cases involving misclassification do not apply here because plaintiffs in this case are not
asking the court to “second guess” defendants’ decision to classify them as nonexempt
employees. Here, defendants have already made the business decision on how to pay plaintiffs,
and plaintiffs do not challenge that business decision. Both parties here are in agreement that the
plaintiffs are hourly employees who are entitled to overtime when they work over 40 hours in a
week. Essentially, the conclusion that the failure to pay employees for overtime is a business
decision, is limited to situations involving the decision to classify employees as “exempt” or
“nonexempt.” In cases like this one, however, not involving the classification of employees, but
rather the incorrect crediting of non-exempt employees’ hours and the corresponding failure to
maintain accurate records sufficient to determine benefits, courts have concluded that proper
crediting is part of an employer’s fiduciary duties under ERISA.
As a result, defendants must now be held to the “strict fiduciary standards” placed on
them by sponsoring and administering an employee benefit plan regulated by ERISA. See
Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539, at *19. In short, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to credit employees with all time they worked.
Accordingly, plaintiffs’ claims for failure to keep accurate records and breach of fiduciary duties
may not be dismissed on the ground that they are based on non-fiduciary business decisions. At
the very least, this issue involves questions of fact and cannot be determined on a motion to
dismiss. See Rosenburg, 2006 WL 1627108, at *3-5.

PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS SUPPORT THE INFERENCE THAT
DEFENDANTS WERE NOT ADMINISTERING THE PLAN IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS
Defendants argue that they cannot have breached any fiduciary duties because they

simply administered the plan in accordance with its terms. Specifically, defendants argue that,
under the plain meaning of the Plan, there is no duty to make contributions based on wages that
were not actually paid to a participant. Defendants’ argument is incorrect both factually and
legally.
Factually, defendants argument is belied by their own submission, which demonstrates
that an ‘hour of service,” for which contributions must be made, includes not only each hour for
which the employee is paid, but also each hour for which an employee is entitled to payment.
See Defs.’ Br. p.11, n. 6. Just because defendants dispute whether plaintiffs were entitled to
payment for the off-the-clock work alleged in this case does not in any way entitle them to a
determination, as a matter of law, that they were not required to make contributions for those
hours of service. On this ground alone, defendants’ argument should be rejected. Indeed, the
only two cases cited by defendants to support their argument involved plans that required
contributions on compensation actually paid and are thus inapplicable to the case at bar. See
Zipp, 632 F. Supp. 2d 1117; Maranda v. Group Health Plan, Inc., Case No. 07-4655 DSD/SRN,
2008 WL 2139584 (D. Minn. May 20, 2008).
In any event, even if defendants correctly characterized the terms of the plan, their
argument is legally unsound and should nevertheless be rejected. See Gerlach v. Wells Fargo &

-8-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 9 of 16

Co., No. C 05-0585 CW, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46788 (N.D. Cal. June 13, 2005). In Gerlach,
the defendant made the same argument as the defendants here, relying on language in the plan
concerning the definition of compensation.

The plan in Gerlach defined compensation to

include “‘all compensation paid to the Participant by the Participating Employer during a
particular calendar quarter for service as an Active Participant which is reportable on a Form W2.’” See Gerlach, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46788, at *4. The court found the defendant’s
argument to be unpersuasive:
Under Defendant’s interpretation of the Plan, a Plan participant
could earn wages that qualify, under terms of the Plan, as certified
compensation, but could be deprived of the corresponding pension
credits if Defendant illegally withheld those wages. The central
allegation of the complaint, which must be accepted as true for
purposes of this motion, is that Defendant violated the FLSA by
not paying Plaintiff overtime wages for overtime work. As
Plaintiff argues, Defendant should not be permitted to create the
illusion of establishing a pension benefit plan under ERISA, only
to avoid thereafter the obligation to pay benefits by violating
federal law.
Gerlach, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46788, at *7-8.
The reasoning of Gerlach should be followed here. Indeed, even if it were permissible
for an employer to define compensation to exclude unpaid wages and overtime, which it is not,
defendants’ explanation of how compensation is defined in the Plan is inapposite of the common
law rules which govern the interpretation of ERISA plans. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,
481 U.S. 41, 56 (1987); Varity, 516 U.S. at 497; Dobson v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Group, Inc. 389
F.3d 386, 399 (2nd Cir. 2004); Herzberger v. Standard Ins. Co., 205 F.3d 327, 330 (7th Cir.
2000) (holding that an ERISA plan is a type of contract, the meaning of which “is ordinarily
decided by the court, rather than by a party to the conference, let alone the party that drafted it”).
Thus, as contracts, ERISA plans include, “not only the promises set forth in express words, but,

-9-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 10 of 16

in addition, all such implied provisions as are indispensible to effectuate the intention of the
parties and as arise from the language of the contact and the circumstances under which [they
were] made.” Sacramento Navigation Co. v. Salz, 273 U.S. 326, 329 (1927).
These federal common law rules of interpretation render defendants’ very narrow
definitions of “Compensation” and “Hours of Service” illogical. When the rules are applied in
context of the Plan as a whole and given reasonable meaning, the Plan’s definition of
compensation must include all base pay, overtime pay, shift differentials, annual incentive
compensation and commissions that employees earned as a product of their working hours as
defined by the applicable wage and hour statutes. See e.g. Defs.’ Br., Ex. A, p. 2, § 1.8.
Although defendants argue that the proper interpretation is to ignore federal wage and hour laws
and instead define compensation as merely the actual amounts paid, the governing principles of
contract interpretation provide that the definition of compensation must take into account
compliance with wage and hour laws. Thus, the rules of ERISA contract interpretation dictate
that defendants will pay its employees for their service in accordance with the applicable FLSA
wage and hour laws, and that plaintiffs’ benefits are determined by those wages.
Defendants’ reliance upon Bremer v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 16 F. Supp. 2d
1057 (D. Minn. 1997), is easily distinguishable from the present case. Bremer involved the
granting of the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, which the court concluded was
proper only after the parties had performed discovery and developed a factual record which
demonstrated the defendants’ decision to deny benefits was reasonable. However, in the present
case it would be premature to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims on a motion to dismiss where there has
been no opportunity for discovery regarding how defendants’ lack of compliance with wage and
hour laws makes their denial of benefits reasonable in the context of the Plan’s language.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE STATED A VALID CLAIM UNDER § 502(A)(3) AND
WERE NOT REQUIRED TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
Defendants next argue that plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages, making their claims

under § 502(a)(3)2 improper. Additionally, defendants assert that, because plaintiffs’ are actually
seeking benefits, their claims are subject to exhaustion. As discussed below, plaintiffs are only
seeking equitable relief, consistent with having brought their claims under § 502(a)(3), and
because plaintiffs are not seeking benefits, the exhaustion requirements do not apply.
A. Plaintiffs’ Claims are Properly Brought Under § 502(a)(3)
Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because § 502(a) is not the
appropriate vehicle for their claim. As explained below, defendants’ arguments fail because
plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief, and civil remedies are permitted, making their
recordkeeping claim brought pursuant to § 502(a) appropriate.
Courts permit plaintiffs to bring recordkeeping claims under § 1132 as it empowers
plaintiffs to seek civil remedies for any violation of ERISA, including record-keeping violations.
See e.g., Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539, at *18 (allowing plaintiffs to state a recordkeeping claim
under § 1132); accord Rosenburg, 2006 WL 1627108, at *8; In re Farmers, 2005 WL 1972565,
at *3 (denying defendant’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ recordkeeping claims); see also Fin. Inst.
Ret. Fund v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 964 F.2d 142, 148 (2d Cir.) (“§ 1132 essentially
empowers beneficiaries to bring a civil action to redress any violation of the statute's fiduciary
requirements”).
Here, plaintiffs have made it clear that they seek an equitable remedy—proper
crediting—not a payment of benefits under the plans. As the complaint clearly sets forth,
plaintiffs have not brought their claims under § 502(a)(3) seeking money damages, but seek
2

29 U.S.C. §1132(a)(3)

-11-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 12 of 16

equitable relief for defendants’ failure to fulfill their fiduciary obligations. Thus, plaintiffs have
appropriately brought their claims under § 502(a)(3) and courts routinely uphold recordkeeping
claims under this provision.3 See Rosenburg, 2006 WL 1627108 at *7 (citing Varity Corp. v.
Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 511 (1996) (§ 502(a)(3) provides “appropriate equitable relief from any
statutory violation for injuries caused by violations that § 1132 does not elsewhere adequately
remedy”)).
Indeed, at this stage, a suit for money damages for unpaid benefits under the plan would
not be appropriate. Thus, in contending that plaintiffs’ claim could have been brought as a claim
for unpaid funds under ERISA § 502(a)(1)(b), defendants fail to recognize that they have failed
to credit plaintiffs for time worked or even investigate crediting overtime pay as compensation
used to determine benefits, as such benefits have yet to be calculated.

Plaintiffs’ complaint is

clear that any present violation is with respect to crediting time worked, and any actual benefits
due are thus not ascertainable at this time. Accordingly § 502(a)(1)(b) could not provide the
appropriate remedy.
Defendants rely on Premick v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc., No. 02:06cv0530, 2007 WL
141913 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2007), in support of their argument. In the first instance, the entire
ERISA discussion in Premick is dicta inasmuch as the Court dismissed the underlying FLSA
claims and did not need to analyze the ERISA claims. Id. at *6. Therefore, its value as even
persuasive authority is minimal.

3

Second, for the reasons stated above, it is respectfully

Thus, defendants’ argument regarding whether a private cause of action may be brought under § 209(a) is
of no moment. Assuming, arguendo, that they are correct, plaintiffs’ may maintain their § 209(a) claims
under § 1132. See generally Trustees of Chicago Painters & Decorators Pension Health & Welfare, and
Deferred Sav. Plan Trust Funds v. Royal Int’l Drywall & Decorating, Inc., 493 F.3d 782, 786 (7th Cir.
2007) (“[S]imply maintaining time sheets, however, is not enough to comply with the statute unless the
time sheets are sufficient to determine the actual hours worked, and thus the benefits due).

Filed 01/14/11 Page 13 of 16

submitted that the Premick court’s characterization of the plaintiff’s claims there as claims for
benefits is incorrect and against the weight of authority. It should therefore not be followed here.
B. Plaintiffs Were Not Required to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
Defendants also argue that plaintiffs’ ERISA claims should be dismissed for failure to
allege the exhaustion of administrative remedies on the ground that plaintiffs’ claims are really
claims for benefits. As explained above, plaintiffs are not seeking benefits at this stage.
Further, plaintiffs are not required to exhaust administrative remedies for claims arising
from violations of substantive statutory provisions such as 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a) and 29 U.S.C §
1132(a)(3). See Harrow v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 279 F.3d 244, 253 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing
Zipf v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 799 F.2d 889, 891 (3d Cir. 1986)) (court recognizes that
administration exhaustion not required for claims brought under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. §1104(a));
Rosenburg, 2006 WL 1627108, at *8 (citing Horan v. Kaiser Steel Ret. Plan, 947 F.2d 1412,
1416 n.1 (9th Cir. 1991)) (“[B]ecause… plaintiffs appropriately brought their claims under
ERISA's catchall provision, this issue [of exhaustion] is moot. Exhaustion is not required under
§ 1132(a)(3)”).
However, in the event this Court finds that plaintiffs’ claims are seeking recovery for
unpaid benefits under the Plans, plaintiffs were not required to exhaust the administrative
remedies before bringing this suit because such recourse would be futile and inadequate.
“The purposes of the exhaustion requirement are to ‘(1) uphold Congress' desire that
ERISA trustees be responsible for their actions, not the federal courts; (2) provide a sufficiently
clear record of administrative action if litigation should ensue; and (3) assure that any judicial
review of fiduciary action (or inaction) is made under the arbitrary and capricious standard and
not de novo.’” Stewart v. NYNEX Corp., 78 F. Supp. 2d 172, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (citing

-13-

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 14 of 16

Kennedy v. Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 989 F.2d 588, 594 (2d Cir. 1993)). However, if
plaintiffs can make a “clear and positive” showing of futility, the “purposes behind the
requirement of exhaustion are no longer served” and there is no exhaustion requirement. Id.
(citing Kennedy, 989 F.2d at 594-95).
Here, plaintiffs can make such a clear and positive showing.

As described above,

plaintiffs’ claims do not stem from the non-payment of benefits, which could be remedied by the
plan’s administrative process. Rather, defendants’ failure to properly account hours and pay
employees for hours they worked has resulted in inaccurate payroll records from which credits
under the Plan are derived; therefore, there is presently no contested benefit decision to take up
with the Plan.
Further, plaintiffs presently have no administrative recourse within the Plans for a proper
accounting and crediting of such hours because defendants have not maintained the records to do
so.

As such, no administrative plan proceedings would make plaintiffs whole, and such

proceedings would be futile. See e.g., Stickle, 2008 WL 4446539, at *17 (finding it “would be
futile to exhaust administrative duties with the Plan because the Plan has not received adequate
accounting”). However, this suit will provide an effective means for determining the existence
of a violation and for providing an adequate remedy as the facts require.

Administrative

exhaustion would not do so, and thus dismissal is not appropriate.
VI.

PLAINTIFFS’ ERISA CLAIMS ARE RIPE
Courts routinely hold that a plaintiff’s ERISA claims are ripe and fit for review, even

when dependent upon the plaintiffs’ FLSA claims. See Rosenburg, 2006 WL 1627108 at *8-9

Case 4:09-cv-40152-FDS Document 65

Filed 01/14/11 Page 15 of 16

CW, 2007 WL 163189 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2005) (court refused to grant motion to dismiss
ERISA claims that were dependent on the final disposition of unpaid overtime claims, and found
the ERISA claims fit for review); In re Farmers, 2005 WL 1972565 at *5 (court refused to
dismiss the plaintiff’s ERISA claims even though those claims were dependent on overtime
liability claims against defendant).
Accordingly, plaintiffs’ ERISA claims are ripe despite their dependence on the final
resolution of the FLSA claims, and defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.
VII.

PLAINTIFFS REQUEST
NECESSARY

THE

OPPORTUNITY

TO

RE-PLEAD

IF

In the event the Court determines that additional allegations are necessary for any of
plaintiffs’ ERISA claims, plaintiffs respectfully request an opportunity to re-plead. See Foman v.
Davis, 371 US 178, 182 (1962); see also Spear v. Somers Sanitation Serv., 162 F.R.D. 1, 2-4 (D.
Mass. 1995) (granting plaintiffs leave to amend in order to afford him “an opportunity to test his
claim on the merits”).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
plaintiffs’ ERISA causes of action should be denied.
