MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF ORDER FOR APPEAL
PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C., SECTION 1292(b)

I.
INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs first amended complaint alleges that approximately 82 apartment complexes
located in 10 states, allegedly designed and constructed by the Spanos Defendants between
1991 and 2007, do not comply with requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act
("FHAA"), 42 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 3601, et seq. Plaintiffs make the same claim with respect to an
unknown number of unidentified properties located, presumably, throughout the United States
in unspecified locations. The Subject Properties allegedly contain over 22,000 apartment
units. Plaintiffs seek an injunction commanding defendants to rebuild or retrofit the Subject
Properties to conform to the FHAA.

On or about February 19, 2008, the Spanos Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(b)(6). The motion to dismiss argued that the first amended
complaint should be dismissed because:

(1) plaintiffs lacked standing;

(2) plaintiffs failed to allege a cause of action; and

(3) plaintiffs' claims were barred under the FHAA's two-year statute of limitations.

On March 26, 2008 this Court issued is order denying the Spanos Defendants' motion
to dismiss. See Exhibit 1, attached.

Il.
FACTS
The allegations of plaintiffs' first amended complaint are nicely stated at pp. 2-5 of this
Court's March 26, 2008 order. See Ex. 1, attached, at pp. 2-5.
Il.
ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED ON APPEAL
The Spanos Defendants seek immediate appeal of this Court's order denying the Spanos

Defendants' motion to dismiss. The appellate issues are:

(1) Have plaintiffs sufficiently alleged standing?

(2) Have plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a cause of action in themselves or anyone

else?

(3) Are plaintiffs' claims barred by the FHAA's two-year statute of limitations?

IV.
THE 12(b)(6) ORDER IS APPROPRIATE FOR CERTIFICATION
UNDER SECTION 1292(b)

An otherwise interlocutory order may be the subject of a petition to the appellate court
for permission to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1292(b) and Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure, Rule 5, if the District Court certifies the order for appeal. Such an order must
involve a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of
opinion and where a resolution thereof will materially advance the termination of the litigation.
The Spanos Defendants believe the order denying their motion to dismiss - - "the 12(b)(6)
Order" - - satisfies all three prerequisites, and therefore request this Court issue a certification
order.

Section 1292(b) authorizes a district court judge issuing an otherwise non-appealable
order, who is of the opinion that the order is appropriate for immediate appeal, to state in that
order the following:

(1) the order involves a controlling question of law; (2) as to

which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and

(3) that an immediate appeal may materially advance the

termination of the litigation.
28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1292(b). If the initial order does not contain such a statement, Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure Rule 5 permits the order to be amended at any time to include the Section
1292(b) statement. Thus, it is appropriate for the Spanos Defendants to seek certification of
the 12(b)(6) order at this time.

Certification of an order for interlocutory appeal is especially appropriate in

"exceptional" cases - - large, protracted or potentially complex civil litigation. In re Cement

Case 4:07-cv-03255-SBA Document107 Filed 04/25/2008 Page 5 of 27

Antitrust Litigation, (MDL No. 296) 673 F.2d 1020, 1026 (9" Cir. 1982) [Section 1292(b)
"was only to be used in exceptional situations in which allowing an interlocutory appeal would
avoid protracted and expensive litigation" ], aff'd. for absence of quorum sub nom., Arizona v.
Ash Grove Cement Co., 459 U.S. 1190 (1983); United States Rubber Co. v. Wright, 359 F.2d
784, 785 (9" Cir. 1966) [interlocutory appeal appropriate in "extraordinary cases where
decision of an interlocutory appeal might avoid protracted and expensive litigation" ]; Steering
Committee v. United States, 6 F.3d 572, 575 (9" Cir. 1993) [section 1292(a) certification is
appropriate where resolution of liability issues will eliminate need for trial].

As this Court is well aware, this is an extraordinary civil action. If an interlocutory
appeal is permitted, this Court can implement any decision of the Ninth Circuit favorable to the
Spanos Defendants on remand. Trial of this case will thereby be expedited or avoided
altogether, and will not be delayed.

A. THE 12(b)(6) ORDER INVOLVES CONTROLLING QUESTIONS OF
LAW.

The issues raised by the 12(b)(6) Order are controlling questions of law. All three
issues raised are case dispositive.

If plaintiffs lack standing, this case must be dismissed. The same is true if plaintiffs
lack a cause of action. And, the Spanos defendants' statute of limitations defense is case
dispositive as to all apartment complexes built more than two years before suit was filed.'

B. THIS COURT SHOULD DECLARE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL GROUND

FOR DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AS TO THE 12(b)(6) ORDER

A substantial ground for difference of opinion exists regarding all 3 issues sought to be

 

' See United States v. Woodbury, 263 F.2d 784 (9" Cir. 1959) ["we do not hold that a
question brought here on interlocutory appeal must be dispositive of the lawsuit in order to be
regarded as a controlling question"]. "Courts have refused to interpret the phrase so narrowly
as to require that reversal of the district court's order terminate the litigation." Cement
Antitrust Litig., 673 F.2d at 1026 ["[A]ll that must be shown in order for a question to be
`controlling' is that resolution of the issue on appeal could materially affect the outcome of
litigation in the district court" ].

certified. See, e.g., R. Schwemm, "Barriers to Accessible Housing: Enforcement Issues in
Design and Construction Cases under the Fair Housing Act, 40 U. Richmond L.Rev. 753,
(2006), explaining that case law conflicts on the issues of (1) standing under the FHAA; (2)
who is liable under the FHAA; and (3) whether the continuing violations doctrine avoids the
FHAA's statute of limitations.

1. Issue 1 - Have Plaintiffs Alleged Standing?

To show standing under Article III: "[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the
requested relief." Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984), emphasis added.

a. Case Law Conflicts Regarding Whether Plaintiffs' First
Amended Complaint Alleges Unlawful Conduct.

As this Court's order explains: "[p]laintiffs . . . do not allege that any disabled
individual has actually suffered any injury because of the [Spanos Defendants'] allegedly
discriminatory acts." Ex. 1, 12(b)(6) Order, p. 12:10-13.

Courts differ regarding whether allegations of mere failure to "design and construct" - -
without the consequent denial of a rental or other injury - - alleges a violation of law, sufficient
to support standing. See Fair Housing Council v. Village of Olde St. Andrews, Inc., 210
F.App'x. 469, 480 (6" Cir. 2006) ["[F]rom a purely textual standpoint a violation of the
relevant Fair Housing Act provision here requires more than the mere design and construction
of a noncompliant housing unit. Recall, the text of the Fair Housing Act itself focuses on
housing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing units"]. Emphasis in original,
unpublished disposition. And see, Independent Housing Services of San Francisco v. Fillmore
Center, 840 F.Supp. 1328 at 1335 (N.D. Cal. 1993) [To plead an "unlawful act" [i]t is...
sufficient to allege that . . . but for the inaccessible features] the excluded person would
otherwise go into the building"]; see also, Wilson v. Glenwood Intermountain Properties, Inc.,
98 F.3d 590, 594 (10" Cir. 1996) [discrimination cannot be the cause of injury to a plaintiff
who would not have sought to obtain the benefit even in the absence of the discrimination];

challenged unlawful discrimination have standing to sue].

b. Case Law Conflicts Regarding Whether Plaintiffs' Voluntarily
Incurred Injury Will Support Standing.

This Court's 12(b)(6) order states:

Plaintiffs do not allege that they have had to divert resources
because a disabled individual complained to them about the
Spanos Defendants' discriminatory practices; indeed they do not
allege that any disabled individual has actually suffered any injury
because of the allegedly discriminatory acts. They instead allege
only that they "became aware" of the alleged practices, and that
they have had to divert resources to "identify, investigate, and
counteract" such practices. Therefore, defendants argue,
plaintiffs' alleged injuries are "self-inflicted" "expenses of
litigation," which the Ninth Circuit suggested in Pacific
Properties are, standing alone, insufficient to constitute a
"diversion of resources" under this test. Pacific Properties, 358
F.3d at 1101 ["Fair Housing avoided the question whether the
expense of litigation alone is enough to constitute a `diversion of
resources' under this test, but the court had previously indicated
that such an allegation is generally insufficient"] citing
Lakewood, 272 F.3d at 1124, n. 3 (internal citations omitted).

Ex. 1, 12(b)(6) Order, p. 12:10-21.

Courts differ regarding whether voluntarily incurred injury will support standing. See
e.g., Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27-29 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ["[A]n
organization cannot, of course, manufacture the injury necessary to maintain a suit from its
expenditure of resources on that very suit"]; Project Sentinel v. Evergreen Ridge Apartments,
40 F.Supp.2d 1136, 1140-1141 (N.D. Cal. 1999) ["Plaintiff cannot manufacture standing by
asserting an abstract interest in `monitoring and investigating housing providers and bringing
about compliance with state and federal housing laws' and then claiming the cost of litigation
as the sole underlying Article III injury. Rather, plaintiff must demonstrate that the
defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct somehow affected plaintiff's ability to operate, thereby
giving rise to the need to divert funds to litigation. In the present case, defendants' alleged
conduct did not obstruct plaintiff's mission, it created plaintiff's mission" ].

c. Case Law Conflicts Regarding Whether Plaintiffs Have
Alleged Redressability.

If plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief, their alleged injury - - frustration of

mission - - is not redressable. Plaintiffs seek nationwide injunctive relief, yet no plaintiff is
disabled, and "[p]laintiffs . . . do not allege that any disabled person has actually suffered an
injury because of the [Spanos Defendants'] allegedly discriminatory acts." Ex. 1, 12(b)(6)
Order, p. 12:10-13.

Courts differ regarding whether someone who is not disabled and has not been sought
to rent has standing to seek injunctive relief. See Molski v. Mandarin Touch Restaurant, 385
F.Supp.2d 1042 (C.D. Cal. 2005); and see, e.g., Harris v. Itzhaki, 183 F.3d 1043, 1050 cg"
Cir. 1999) [Plaintiff's request for declaratory and injunctive relief rendered moot by her
departure from the complex].

In addition, plaintiffs do not allege that this Court has personal jurisdiction over the
owner defendants. Absent bringing the owner defendants into this case, injunctive relief is not
feasible. And, substantial differences of opinion exists regarding whether due process requires
that a court have personal jurisdiction over the owner defendant class members. See Whitson
v. Heilig-Meyers Furniture, Inc., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4312, *49 (N.D. Ala. 1995); see,
also, National Assn. for Mental Health, Inc. v. Califano, 717 F.2d 1451, 1455 (D.C. Cir.
1983) [affirming district court's order refusing to certify a defendant class where the named
representatives would not "fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class" and where
the district court did "not have in personam jurisdiction over the class members".

2. Issue 2 - Have Plaintiffs Alleged A Cause Of Action?

The Spanos Defendants are not alleged to be the owners of the complexes sued on.

Opinions differ regarding whether only owners, and not developers, may be held liable for

denial of a rental in an FHAA design and construction case. See, e.g., Growth Horizons, Inc.

 

v. Delaware County, 983 F.2d 1277, 1283 (3d Cir. 1993). Lonberg v. Sanborn Theatres, 259
F.3d 1029, 2001 U.S.App.LEXIS 17418, at *18 (9" Cir. 2001) ["[A]fter [a] noncompliant
building has already been built, injunctive relief is only meaningful against the person
currently in control of the building. That is, the architect who built the building is by the time
of suit by an eligible plaintiff out of the picture. This limitation on relief suggests that reading

Title II to make architects, and others who do not own, lease, or operate buildings, such as

builders and construction subcontractors, liable for "design and construct" discrimination
would create liability in persons against whom there is no meaningful remedy provided by the

statute].

3. Issue 3 - Are Plaintiffs' Claims Barred By The FHAA's Statute of
Limitations?

Courts differ regarding whether the continuing violations doctrine is applicable to an
FHAA design and construct case. See e.g., Hargraves v. Capital City Mortgage Corp., 140
F.Supp.2d 7, 18 (D.D.C. 2000) citing Taylor v. FDIC, 132 F.3d 753, 764-765 (D.D.C.
1997). See also, United States v. Pac. Northwest Electric, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7990, *15
(D. Idaho Nov. 20, 2003) ["This `failure' [to design and construct] occurs and is complete at
the time the particular dwellings are designed and/or constructed. There is no basis, under the
plain language of 0x00A7 3604(f)(3) of the FHA for applying the continuing violation doctrine" ].

C. AN IMMEDIATE APPEAL FROM THE 12(b)(6) ORDER WILL
MATERIALLY ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE TERMINATION OF THIS
LITIGATION.

Because all three issues sought to be certified for appeal are case dispositive, immediate

appeal will accelerate and not delay this litigation
V.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Spanos Defendants respectfully requests that this Court
issue an order certifying the order of April 4, 2008, for immediate appeal pursuant to 28
U.S.C. section 1292(b).
