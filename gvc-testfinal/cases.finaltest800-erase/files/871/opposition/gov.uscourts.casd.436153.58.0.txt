PROCEEDING IN California Rifle &
Pistol Association, Incorporated v.
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, et al, U.S. District Court
Eastern District of California, Case No.
1:14-cv-01211-JAM-SAB

Defendants.
Plaintiff Lycurgan, Inc., through its below counsel of record provides the
following status report regarding the docket in California Rifle & Pistol
Association, Incorporated v. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No.
1:14-cv-01211-JAM-SAB.
On Monday, February 26, 2015, counsel for defendants requested additional
time in which to file a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition to the now-pending motion to
stay this case pending the resolution of the action currently pending in another
district entitled California Rifle & Pistol Association, Incorporated v. Bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, et al, U.S. District Court
Eastern District of California, Case No. 1:14-cv-01211-JAM-SAB, i.e., the “the

1 CRPA case.” As a basis for the requested additional time counsel for defendants
2 suggested that the plaintiff in the CRPA case possibly would be dismissing the
3 action on or before March 11, 2015. But no dismissal occurred.
4

Rather, the parties in the CRPA case agreed to delay resolution in that case

5 for additional time.
6

On March 6, 2015, counsel for defendants here, i.e., Lisa Olson, executed a

7 stipulation to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment set in the
8 CRPA case. The Court in the CRPA case entered an order on the stipulation on
9 March 9, 2015. [Exhibit ‘A’.] The new hearing date for the Government’s motion
10 in the CRPA case is May 6, 2015.
11

Respectfully submitted,
