Case No.: 14CV548 JLS (BGS)

DECLARATION OF LISA A. OLSON
IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT'S EX
PARTE MOTION FOR EXTENSION
OF TIME TO FILE REPLY IN
SUPPORT OF MOTION TO STAY
AND FOR CONTINUANCE OF
MARCH 12 HEARING DATE

Hon. Janis L. Sammartino

L LISA A. OLSON, declare as follows:

1. I am a Senior Trial Counsel with the United States Department of Justice

and represent defendant United States in this case.

2. I submit this Declaration in support of Defendant's Ex Parte Motion for
Extension of Time to File Reply in Support of Motion to Stay Proceedings and for

Continuance of March 12 Hearing Date.

3. Defendant's reply in support of its motion to stay proceedings (ECF #46)

is currently due on February 26, 2015, and a hearing on the motion to stay is
scheduled for March 12, 2015. Defendant requests an extension of time until March
13, 2015, within which to file any reply, and if the extension is granted, defendant
requests a continuance of the hearing to a date convenient to the Court.

4. As defendant informed the Court in its motion to stay, the proceedings in
a similar case challenging ATF's classification of the EP80 as a firearm, California
Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bureau_of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives ("ATE"), No. 1:14-cv-01211 (E.D. Cal.) ("CalRifle"), had reached a more
advanced stage than this case and could ultimately have resulted in a decision which
could govern or narrow the issues here. Defendant now requests an extension of time
because, on approximately February 19, 2015, the plaintiff in CalRifle advised
undersigned counsel that it is likely to voluntarily dismiss its case pursuant to Rule
41(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is possible that the United States
will not oppose CalRifle's motion, and if CalRifle is dismissed, defendant may
withdraw its motion to stay these proceedings. It would disserve the interests of
judicial efficiency and economy for defendant to pursue a motion before this Court
that may soon be withdrawn. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.

5. CalRifle has advised undersigned counsel that it will make a final
decision about whether to dismiss CalRifle on or before March 11, 2015, the due date
for its opposition to the United States' motion to dismiss, or alternatively for summary
judgment in that case. Defendant therefore requests an extension of time until March
13, 2015, within which to file its reply in support of its motion to stay these
proceedings, so that it will have adequate time to draft any reply or to take other
appropriate action in this case after CalRifle's March 11, 2015 deadline expires. If the
extension is granted, defendant also requests a continuance of the hearing to a later
date as appropriate and convenient to the Court.

6, The requested extension and continuance are reasonable, will not

prejudice the parties, and will not unduly delay this case.

7. Plaintiff's counsel has informed defendant's counsel that plaintiff does not

oppose an extension of time until March 11, but does oppose an extension of time

until March 13, 2015.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
