TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

2

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b),

3

Defendants Neuralstem, Inc., Karl K. Johe, and I. Richard Garr (collectively “Defendants”)

4

respectfully request that this Court extend the time to answer or otherwise respond to StemCells,

Inc. and StemCells California, Inc.’s (collectively “StemCells” or “Plaintiffs”) Amended
Complaint until the lesser of: (1) ten 10 days after the District of Maryland’s ruling on StemCells’
potential Motion to Transfer or (2) sixty (60) days.1
I.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

10

On May 7, 2008, Neuralstem filed a declaratory judgment action in the District of Maryland

11

(the “Maryland Action”), seeking a declaration that U.S. Patent 7,361,505 (“the ‘505 patent’) is

12

invalid, not infringed and unenforceable.2 On May 13, 2008, defendant Neuralstem filed a First

13

Amended Complaint, adding invalidity and non-infringement claims against U.S. Patent 7,115,418

14
(“the ‘418 patent’) and seeking a declaration that statements made regarding the reexamination of
15
16

certain StemCells patents do not constitute “trade libel” or “unfair competition.” Because the

17

Maryland Action pre-dates the instant matter and the two actions are substantially identical,

18

Defendants filed a Motion to Stay, Dismiss or Transfer in this Court on May 30, 2008. (Dkt. No.

19

19, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay). For reasons stated therein, Defendants

20

believe the District of Maryland—i.e. the first filed court—is the proper forum.

21

On July 1, 2008, this Court held “the first-to-file rule is applicable” and “defer[red] to the

22
District of Maryland to decide the appropriate forum and whether an exception to the first-to-file
23
24
25
26
27

rule is applicable.” (Dkt. No. 37, Order at 8).

It further instructed that if StemCells wished to

have its complaint heard in this Court it should file a motion to transfer the Maryland Action no

later than July 15, 2008. (Id.). Finally, this Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss, transfer

2

or stay this action and stated that the case management conference scheduled for August 26, 2008

3

will go forward, “unless by that date the case has been transferred to Maryland or stayed.” (Id.).

4
5
6

As of today, StemCells has not filed a Motion to Transfer in the Maryland Action.
Nevertheless, recent correspondence from StemCells’ counsel indicates that it intends to file a
motion transfer on July 15, 2008, the very last day of this Court’s deadline. (Ex. A). StemCells’

7
8
9
10

decision to wait until July 15, 2008 to file its motion virtually guarantees that the Maryland Court
will not have sufficient time to rule on the forum issue before the Case Management Conference
scheduled for August 26, 2008.

11

On July 2, 2008, counsel for Defendants requested a limited extension of time to file an

12

answer or otherwise respond to StemCells’ First Amended Complaint. (Ex. B). On July 7, 2008,

13

counsel for StemCells rejected this request. (Ex. C). Specifically, counsel for StemCells claimed

14
that an extension of time was inconsistent with this Court’s July 1, 2008 Order. (Ex. C).
15
16

II.

LAW AND ARGUMENT

17

“A district court has inherent power to control the disposition of the causes on its docket in

18

a manner which will promote economy of time and effort, for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”

19

See, e.g., Filtrol Corp. v. Kelleher, 467 F.2d 242 (9th Cir. 1973). Under Federal Rule of Civil

20

Procedure 6(b)(1), “[w]hen an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may for

21

good cause, extend the time: (A) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is

22
made, before the original time or its extension expires.”
23
24

Defendants respectfully request this Court extend the time to answer or otherwise respond

25

to StemCells’ First Amended Complaint until after the District of Maryland decides the appropriate

26

forum and whether an exception to the first-to-file rule is applicable.

27

pleadings in this case before that time would undermine the purpose of the first-to-file rule and

28
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO ANSWER OR
OTHERWISE RESPOND TO AMENDED COMPLAINT
CASE NO. C 08-02364 (CW)

2

Proceeding with the

Case 4:08-cv-02364-CW

1

Document 38

Filed 07/14/2008

Page 4 of 6

would result in costly duplicative litigation that Defendants believe this Court intended to avoid.

2

In Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Micron Semiconductors, Inc., for example, the court rejected

3

the plaintiff’s argument that a second-filed court can proceed, in its discretion, as long as it does

4

not interfere with the first-filed court’s jurisdiction. 815 F. Supp. 994, 999 (E.D. Tex. 1993)

5
6

(“federal district courts are courts of coordinate jurisdiction and equal rank, and must exercise care
to avoid interference with each other’s affairs and duplicative litigation”). The court explained,

7
8
9

“[a]ny other conclusion would undermine the considerations of comity that courts of concurrent
jurisdiction must observe.” Id.

Similarly, in Custom Energy, LLC v. Liebert Corp., the court

10

granted the defendants an extension of time to file responsive pleadings until ten days after the

11

first-filed court determined the appropriate forum. 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8319, at *5 (D. Kan.

12

June 1, 1998) (“the Court will grant an extension until ten days after the Ohio court issues an order

13

determining the appropriate forum”).

14
Based on the language of the Order, Defendants do not believe this Court intended to have
15
16

the parties address substantive issues before the District of Maryland decides the appropriate forum

17

and whether an exception to the first-to-file rule is applicable. (See Order at 8). Having this case

18

proceed along with the Maryland case simultaneously would unduly increase the Defendants’

19

litigation costs by forcing them to litigate the same issues in two forums and waste already scarce

20

judicial resources by burdening this Court with substantive motions—and additional briefing—

21

before the Maryland court has ruled. These are precisely the sort of inefficiencies that applying the

22
first-to-file rule is designed to prevent.
23
24

As this Court has recognized, a motion under the first-to-file rule is not considered within

25

the ambit of the defenses enumerated in Rule 12(b). Fujitsu Ltd v. Nanya Tech. Corp., 2007 WL

26

484789, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2007) (noting “motions under the first-to-file rule are generally

27

considered to be outside of the ambit of the Rule 12(b) motions that suffice as responsive

OTHERWISE RESPOND TO AMENDED COMPLAINT

Case 4:08-cv-02364-CW

pleadings”). Accordingly, Defendants have the right to file a substantive motion to dismiss under
Rule 12(b) concurrent with any responsive pleading.

3

As Defendants previously pointed out, the Amended Complaint fails to meet Rule 8(a)’s

4

pleading requirements, thus warranting at least a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon

5

which relief can be granted.3

6

(Dkt. No 19, Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay at 1 n.1).

Plaintiffs, moreover, have plead no facts sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction

7
8
9

over the two non-resident defendants (Mr. Garr and Dr. Johe) both of whom are Neuralstem
officers. (See Amended Complaint, at ¶¶ 3-9, Dkt. No. 19 at 6, lines 6-7). Plaintiffs’ related unfair

10

competition and trade libel claims likewise suffer from similar deficiencies. Absent an extension

11

of time, Neuralstem, StemCells, and this Court will be forced to expend considerable resources

12

addressing these threshold issues, all of which would be moot if the Maryland court denies

13

StemCells’ to-be-filed motion to transfer.

14
Defendants do not seek this extension to delay the resolution of this matter, they only desire
15
16

to avoid litigating the same issues in two different courts simultaneously until the proper forum is

17

decided. Indeed, Defendants filed a declaratory judgment action in Maryland before this case to

18

have these issues resolved. Under these circumstances, a limited extension of time to respond to

19

the Amended Complaint until the forum issue is resolved would conserve judicial resources and

20

ensure that Defendants do not have to answer repetitive allegations on a piecemeal basis.

21

CONCLUSION

22
For reasons state above, Defendants’ respectfully request this Court grant their Motion to
23
24
25
26
27

Extend Time to Answer or Otherwise Respond to StemCells’ Amended Complaint until the lesser
of ten (10) days after the Maryland court determines the appropriate forum as called for by this
3

Plaintiffs effectively conceded that their Amended Complaint is deficient by belatedly
identifying new facts that they claim support their infringement allegations in their Opposition
to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay. (Dkt No. 33, Opposition to Defendants’
Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay at 5 n.3).

Subject: RE: Neuralstem, Inc. v. StemCells, Inc et al. - Civil Action No. 08-1877
Sanjay We disagree on the service issue. Nevertheless, we interpret the Court's Order as requiring a response on July
15, 2008 by all of the defendants, which includes Neurospheres.
As of today, I am still working though representation issues and cannot provide you with a response on behalf of
Neurospheres. We should have the representation issues resolved prior to July 15th such that you can expect a
motion to dismiss being filed on behalf of SCI and Neurospheres on the 15th. If we don't work out the
representation issues by the 15th, you can expect Neurospheres' counsel will file something by the 15th.

Dear John:
As you know Neurospheres Holding Ltd. ("Neurospheres") was served on June 12, 2008.
Accordingly, its Answer or other response is past due. Please let me know by close of business
today if you will be filing your response. Otherwise, we will move the Court to enter default
judgment.
Neurospheres was not a party to StemCells, Inc. and StemCells California, Inc.'s ("StemCells")
motion for an extension of time. In fact, you even disclaimed representing Neurospheres during
our telephonic hearing. Thus, Neurospheres is not covered by Judge Williams' Order and nothing
in the Order indicates otherwise.
Finally, you argued to Judge Williams that you wanted enough time to guarantee that StemCells'
response could be coordinated with Neurospheres' response, which is why StemCells was given
until July 15, 2008, the latest date by which we said service would be perfected, plus 20 days.
Indeed, the relief you requested was for StemCells' response "to be the same date on which the
response is due for the yet to be served Co-Defendant, Neurospheres Holding Ltd," which was
July 2.
