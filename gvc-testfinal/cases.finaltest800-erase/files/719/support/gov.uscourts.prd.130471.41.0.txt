DEFENDANT'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT;

COMES NOW Defendant Fred Rebarber Ocasio, through the undersigned counsel, and
pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 56(b) respectfully submits

this memorandum of law in support of the motion for summary judgment.

I, PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On April 27, 2017, Luis Feliciano Mufioz ("Mr, Feliciano" or "Purchaser") and Air America, Inc. ("Air
America" or "the Corporation"), collectively referred as "the plaintiffs", filed a First Amended

Complaint against Fred Rebarber Ocasio ("Mr, Rebarber" or Seller"), alleging breach of contract.

Plaintiffs alleged the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1332(a) (1) for being a dispute
between citizens of different states given that Plaintiff Luis Feliciano Mufioz is a citizen of Puerto Rico;

Air America, Inc., is a corporation organized pursuant to the General Corporations Act of Puerto Rico

Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 2 of 22

14 L.P.R.A. 0x00A7 3501. (GCA of PR") and Defendant Rebarber is a resident of the stare of Florida, U.S.A.
The events that allegedly entitle the plaintiffs to a cause of action occurred in Puerto Rico and the claim -

exceeds seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00)

Pursuant to the deadlines ordered by this Honorable Court on August 29, 2017 [Docket No. 38},
defendant hereby submits a Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant sustains that Plaintiffs'
allegations do not establish a claim that justifies the granting of a remedy and that that there is no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Moreover, Defendant alleges that the case is frivolous, lacking any merits and with the only purpose of
avoiding Plaintiffs' own contractual responsibilities towards Defendant. Additionally, Defendant alleges
that the Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter given that Plaintiffs did not exhaust intra-
corporative solution to the dispute prior to seeking a judicial remedy as required by the General

Corporations Act of Puerto Rico.

Hl. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Defendant hereby respectfully submits for the consideration of this Honorable Court, the facts and
events that demonstrate that the cause of action for alleged breach of contract in the instant complaint

should be dismissed with prejudice.

Air America, Inc., is a corporation organized pursuant to General Corporations Act of Puerto Rico 14
L.P.R.A. 0x00A7 3501. From the moment of its incorporation on August 30, 2000, the purpose of the

corporation has been to engage in air the airline business as an Federal Aviation Regulations' (FAR) 135
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 3 of 22

ait carrier. (Defendant's UMF 1) The only shareholder from its creation up until December 17, 2014,
was Defendant, Mr. Fred Rebarber Ocasio. Besides the ownership of the 100% of the shares, Mr.
Rebarber's duties in Air America's airline company were working the reservations, running the daily
operations, running the administrative duties, and flying as a pilot. (Defendant's UMF 28 P, 296, L 6-

24)

The company's operations were of flying passengers throughout the Caribbean, as approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in the Operations Specification certification. (Defendant's
UMF 1) In its uninterrupted history since August 2000, the FAA never issued a violation to any airman,

mechanic or to the company itself.

On September 2014, Mr, Rebarber Ocasio was contacted by representatives of the Plaintiff Luis
Feliciano, with a proposal to buy the company. From that moment, both parties engaged in oral and

written communications to culminate the selling agreement.

Within the communications, there were at least three letters of intent (LODissued by Mr. Feliciano
(Defendant's UMF 3, 11 and 12) and finally, a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) was executed on

December 17, 2014.

The terms and conditions of the SPA agreement were basically that defendant Rebarber will sell 80% of
the shares, maintaining 20% for himself. The selling price was agreed in $1,300,000. The payment
schedule was as follows: $100,000 were previously paid on November 12, 2014, as a deposit upon

acceptance of the offer; $950,000 was paid at the signing of the agreement on December 17, 2014, and a
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 4 of 22

final payment of $250,000 twelve (12) months after signing of the agreement. (Defendant's UMF 133,
15) A promissory note to secure the final payment was guaranteed by a lien to one of the aircrafts owned
by the corporation, a Beechcraft King Air E-90, (Defendant's UMF 15) Neither in final letter of intent
(November 14, 2014), nor in the SPA, was there a reference to any guarantee on the condition of the

aircrafts, to continuance of the employees or to the fitness of the operation.

With the purpose of exercising the due diligence to evaluate the object of the sale, Plaintiff Feliciano
retained at least three different professionals, Miguel Nicol4s Moreda (of Porto Capital, CPA,
Restructuring Startup, Tax Planning and CFO Services); Diego Perdomo (Perdomo Ferrer CPA's and
Consultants); and a California based specialist in aviation and aircraft appraisals and acquisitions,

Verlyn Wolfe (Wolfe Aviation, Aircraft Acquisition Sales and Service).

Also, as part of the evaluation process, Mr. Feliciano personally took photographs and physically
evaluate the aircrafts. (Defendant's UMF 19) In addition, Plaintiff Feliciano personally met Defendant
Rebarber at least in two occasions to receive an overall training of reservation and administrative duties

from Mr. Rebarber himself. (Defendant's UMF 28 P, 291, 292);

At the time of the sale, the airline was fully operational, owning six aircrafts. Four were actively flying,
one was on a routine maintenance inspection (went back to service on December 24, 2014)
(Defendant's UMF 36) and another one, a Cessna aircraft, even though had recently flown during 2014,
at the moment of the buying process, was grounded and not operational due to lack of business to use it.
The condition of the aircrafts was well known by the buyer, including the inoperative condition of the

Cessna aircraft. It is noticeable that in at least two of the photographs that Mr. Feliciano took of the
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 5 of 22

aircrafts, the "grounded" condition of the Cessna aircraft was noticeable, showing the absence of
avionics equipment, the opening of an inspection plate in the main cabin and lacking the passenger seats.

(Defendant's UMF 20)

The taking over by Mr. Feliciano of the operations was on December 17, 2014. As part of the SPA, all
debts and expenditures prior to that day were responsibility of the Seller and all debts and expenditures
after that date were the Buyer's responsibility. (Defendant's UMF 13, P. 4 Par 22)

"The Corporation and/or Seller [the Defendant] have satisfied 100% of any known accrued
expenses and debt of the Corporation. Any unrecorded or undisclosed expenses and liabilities related
with the operations of the Corporation prior to this date (the "Unrecorded Expenses") found by the
Purchaser after the date hereof, shall be paid by Seller to the Corporation upon claim thereof by
Purchaser or the Corporation supported by adequate evidence. If Seller fails to reimburse the
Corporation, in addition to any rights available at law to collect the Unrecorded Expenses from face
value of the Note, All expenses incurred by the Corporation prior to the date hereof shall run_on the
account of the Seller; and all expenses incurred by the Corporation after the date hereof will run on
account of the Corporation. In_addition, any expenses incurred by the Corporation after the date
hereof that should have been incurred by the Corporation prior to this date, will be on the account of
the Seller and shall be considered Unrecorded Expenses"

Also, as part of the LOI of November 12", 2014, Mr. Rebarber Ocasio remained available to be
consulted by the hour. Nevertheless, his services were only requested from the end of December 2014,

when Mr. Feliciano went out of Puerto Rico on vacations, up until March 2015 From that date on, he

was never called again for providing his services. (Defendant's UMF 23)

According to the SPA and subsequent Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation filed with the
Department of State, Mr. Rebarber had to resigned as an officer of the corporation and Mr, Feliciano
became the director in charge of all the operations, as president. (Defendant's UMF 25) From

December 17, 2014, the operations continued with Mr. Feliciano as president, overlooking the
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 6 of 22

_ operations and the administrative duties. The mechanical duties were in charge of an FAA authorized

mechanic and the flight operations, were in charge of an authorized and FAA approved pilot.

It is noticeable that on February 10, 2016, Mr. Feliciano held a press conference in which he announced
that since his acquisition of the airline on December 2014, the airline had an increase of 23% of the

operations. (Defendant's UMF 63, 64)

As stated before, as part of the SPA, Mr. Feliciano had to pay $250,000 to Mr. Rebarber by December
17, 2015, nevertheless, right before paying said amount, on November 16, 2015, Mr. Feliciano sent a
letter to Mr. Rebarber requesting $250,000 alleging a breach of contract and for that reason having to
incur in expenditures because supposedly, due to the condition of the aircrafts, these were not being able
to fly. (Defendant's UMF 26) Obviously, Mr. Feliciano's expressions in the press conference, to the
effect that the airline had significant improvements and increase of business since his taking over,

contradicted his reason for claiming losses three months before on his letter to Rebarber.

In response to Feliciano's request, defendant Rebarber replied with a letter stating that Mr. Feliciano had _
to pay the money he owed and reiterated his full compliance with the Federal Administration
Regulations (FAR's) and compliance with the Agreement. Rebarber also stated in his letter that

Plaintiffs letter had the purpose of delaying the owed payment. (Defendant's UMF 27)

Even though Mr. Rebarber had been a minority shareholder since the acquisition of the Corporation by
Mr. Feliciano and remained available to offer his consultation services, after March 2015, he was not

contacted again to render any service. It is also important to emphasize that according to terms of the
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 7 of 22

Amended Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State Department, he was also a member of the
board of directors with the power to manage the corporation's operations, for being a shareholder.

(Exhibit 15 Par. FIFTH)

Nevertheless, on September 26, 2016, Mr. Feliciano, without exhausting intra-corporative remedies, nor
obtaining permission from the other shareholder, in his personal name and Air America's, filed suit
against Fred Rebarber Ocasio, for alleged damages due to false representations regarding the
Corporation's compliance with the FAA regulations. He claimed $300,000 for those alleged damages.

On April 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint raising the request for remedies to

$520,673.16

After several procedural incidents and after conducting a discovery process between the parties, the
Court set different deadlines, including that all dispositive motion and Daubert motions had to be filed

on or before January 16, 2018, which Defendant hereby submits in compliance.

Ill. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

"A motion for summary judgment is governed by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, which entitles a party to judgment if "the movant shows that there is no genuine
dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.
R, Civ. P. 56{a). "A dispute is `genuine' if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable
jury could resolve the point in favor of the non-moving party." Rodriguez-Machado v. VA, 845

F. Supp. 2d 429, 437-438 (D.P.R. 2012) (citing Prescott v. Higgins, 538 F.3d 32, 40 (Ist Cir.
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 8 of 22

2008)(citing Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (ist Cir, 2008)); see also Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L, Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Calero-Cerezo v.
U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (ist Cir. 2004) (stating that an issue is genuine if it can be resolved
in favor of either party). In order for a disputed fact to be considered "material", it must have the
potential "to affect the outcome of the suit under governing law." Sands v. Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d
657, 660-661 (citing Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 247-248); Prescott, supra, at 40 (citing Maymi v.

P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir, 2008).

The principle of the summary judgment is to "pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see
whether there is a genuine need for trial." DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997)

(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(cent) advisory committee note to the 1963 Amendment).

The moving party must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue as to any outcome-

determinative fact on the record. Shalala, 124 F.3d at 306. Upon a showing by the moving party of an
absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that
a trier of fact could reasonably find in his favor. Id. (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323,

106 8, Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).

The non-movant may not rely upon mere allegations to defeat a properly supported motion for summary
judgment; must present definite and competent evidence. Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo Rodriguez, 23
F.3d 576, 581 (ist Cir. 1994). The non-movant's burden requires a showing of "at least one fact issue

which is both `genuine' and `material.'" See Sudrez v. Pueblo Int'l., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (ist Cir. 2000) and
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 9 of 22

Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990).

Local Rule 56(c) states that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall support each denial
or qualification by record citation as required by the rule. Local Rule 56(e) states that the facts contained
in a supporting statement of material facts, if supported by record citations as required by the rule, shall

be deemed admitted unless properly controverted.,

When considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court must examine the facts in the light most
favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor in order to conclude
whether or not there is sufficient evidence in favor of the non-movant for a jury to return a verdict in its
favor, Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co,, 287 F.3d 32, 38 (ist Cir, 2002). The Court must
review the record as a whole and refrain from engaging in an assessment of credibility or weigh the
evidence presented. Reeves vy. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 135, 120 S. Ct. 2097,
147 L, Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The burden placed upon the non-movant is one of production rather than
persuasion. In other words, in weighing a non-movant's opposition to summary judgment the Court
should not engage in jury-like functions related to the determination of credibility. However, the
nonmoving patty must not rest solely upon "conclusory allegations, improbable inferences and
unsupported speculation." Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 1996)

and Medina-Mufioz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).

TV. ARGUMENT

Defendant hereby respectfully submits for the consideration of this Honorable Court, the facts and
Case 3:16-cv-02719-MEL Document 41 Filed 01/16/18 Page 10 of 22

events that demonstrate that the cause of action for alleged breach of contract in the instant complaint
should be dismissed with prejudice. At least there are three different fundamentals which would justify

the requested dismissal.

A. Facts v. Allegations

The magnitude of the lack of merits of this claim is conversely proportional to the amount of false or
erroneous allegations of the complaint. When opposing the facts to each and every relevant and

substantial allegation, it is obvious that the claim lacks merits and should be dismissed.

In essence, the complaint is based in the allegation that Defendant is therefore liable for the damages
caused to Plaintiff as a result of his breach of contract arising from his false representations and

warranties regarding the Corporation's compliance with applicable FAA regulations.

Said allegation is erroneous and does not have any base on reality as admitted by Plaintiff Feliciano

himself both on his responses to request for admissions and to his testimony on his deposition.

Plaintiff alleges that he executed the buying relaying on Defendant's representations and warranties

regarding the Corporation's compliance with the FAA regulations.

First of all, it is important to state that Plaintiff Feliciano did not buy airplanes, he bought the majority of
the shares of Air America, Inc. As part of Air America's assets, there were six airplanes operating under
an FAR 135 airline business. (Exhibit 10 P. 7) In order to make his decision, Mr. Feliciano had the

information provided to him by Defendant, but assessed, inspected and evaluated by three different
