ROBERTSON’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE ARGUMENT REGARDING THE LEGALITY
OF LOCKER SERVICES AND CLOUD COMPUTING
Defendant Michael Robertson (“Robertson”), by and through his undersigned counsel,
respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to
Preclude Argument Regarding the Legality of Locker Services and Cloud Computing, filed on
September 18, 2013 [Doc. No. 421] (the “Motion”). The Motion should be denied because it, in
essence, seeks an inappropriate and vague gag order concerning relevant information which
would aid the jury in understanding the technology at issue in this case and the context in which
that technology was developed.
Plaintiffs forget, intentionally so, the status of cloud computing and locker services in
2005 and thereafter, and how this case came about. In 2006, major labels took the position that a
consumer could not make a copy of a CD he or she owned and upload it to be stored online – in
the cloud – to be retrieved and listened to on a variety of devices, including another computer.
Thus, in February 2006, the Recording Industry Association of America (“RIAA”) – of which
the Label Plaintiffs are prominent members – took the position that “creating a back-up copy of a
music CD is not a non-infringing use,” because “the fact remains that there is no general
exception to the reproduction right to allow back-up copying.” (See RIAA submission,
http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/reply/11metalitz_AAP.pdf).

Robertson was in the

forefront of challenging the major labels to agree that such conduct was lawful by starting locker
services, such as AnywhereCD, long before others had made them commonplace.
With the advent of digital downloads, Robertson – through MP3tunes.com – was in the
forefront of allowing consumers to buy digital music and save it in a locker for playback through
a variety of devices – including phones – at any time and any place. Robertson did that long
before Apple, Google, Amazon and the current market leaders. Plaintiffs seek to forget that

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

Filed 10/09/13 Page 5 of 12

when they started this case, they asserted that even such conduct was unlawful, wholly apart
from sideload.com.
The principal aspect of the infringement claims left in this case are that songs sideloaded
on sideload.com and stored in lockers were not removed from lockers in response to takedown
notices. Again Plaintiffs seek to hide from the facts that:


They were the only label to sue asserting that such conduct was unlawful.



They sued in connection with such conduct despite the proliferation of free
downloads on the internet – including from Plaintiffs (even if they required
marketing information) – and that it was impossible for a user to tell whether a
song available for download was authorized.

Plaintiffs also seek this gag order on Robertson despite arguing that MP3tunes was an
ISP “whose entire business plan consisted of exploiting copyrighted works who had little or no
other use for the site who induced users to commit infringement…. When you have a site that
has no purpose other than to make commercial sound recordings available to the public, the only
use for this is to exploit it and to use it for an improper purpose.” (February 14, 2013 Tr. at 4-6).
The jury is entitled to hear both sides of the context of the websites at issue.
Finally, the relief the Motion seeks is vague: even if the relief was granted, it would be
virtually impossible to draw the line between compliance and inadvertent non-compliance.
More specifically, in essence, the Motion argues that Robertson should not be able to
introduce (1) the background of the technology at issue; (2) draw similarities between the
technologies with which the jury may be familiar and the relevant technological issues, which
Plaintiffs admit “would be unfamiliar to a jury” (see Mem. of Law in Support of the Motion,
filed September 18, 2013 [Doc. No. 422] (“Pl. Br.”) at 5); and (3) the context and background
out of which this litigation arose. Plaintiffs argue that such issues would be irrelevant and
prejudicial. (Id. at 3-5).
2

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

Plaintiffs wish to try this case with no context, no explanation of the technology involved,
and no comparison for the benefit of the jury between a technology with which they are
unfamiliar and other more familiar technologies. (Id. at 2-3 (narrowing defining the issues for
trial)).

Robertson is entitled to explain the relevant technology, to compare the relevant

technology, which is admittedly “unfamiliar to a jury”, to familiar technologies such as Apple
and Google, because such a comparison serves as an effective pedagogical tool, and to explain to
the jury the background and context of this litigation.
The Motion should be denied.
I.

ROBERTSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THE JURY THE
CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND OF THIS LITIGATION
The district court has broad discretion over the admission of evidence, “including

background evidence to show the circumstances surrounding the events or to furnish an
explanation of the intent with which certain acts were performed…” Weyant v. Okst, 182 F.3d
902 (2d Cir. 1999). For this reason, the Weyant court affirmed the admission of a witness’s
testimony that defendant had punched him in the groin, even though the defendant had prevailed
in a prior trial where that witness sued the defendant over that punch. Id.
Similarly, in Williams v. McCarthy, a § 1983 case in connection with the arrest of
plaintiffs, the district court admitted as “background evidence” the fact that plaintiff was on
parole at the time he was arrested, noting that
The trial court may admit evidence that does not directly establish an element of
the offense charged, in order to provide background for the events alleged ....
Background evidence may be admitted to show, for example, the circumstances
surrounding the events or to furnish an explanation of the understanding or intent
with which certain acts were performed.
2007 WL 3125314, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2007) (quoting United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d
1553, 1561 (2d Cir. 1991)); see United States v. McCallum, 348 F. App’x 693, 695 (2d Cir.

2009) (admitting defendant’s uncharged drug activity as background evidence).
Here, Plaintiffs seek to prohibit Robertson from introducing any evidence concerning
MP3tunes’ locker services because the “legality of the functionality of MP3tunes’ locker service
in allowing users to store lawfully obtained music ‘in the cloud’ is not and has never been an
issue for the jury.” (Pl. Br. at 3). This argument, as shown by case law cited above, flatly fails.
First, at the outset of this case, the legitimacy of MP3tunes’ locker service was at issue;
Plaintiffs, in their takedown notices, argued that MP3tunes was not an ISP with DMCA
protection at all. Thus, Plaintiffs stipulated in the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order, dated August
30, 2013, that
MP3tunes received two takedown notices from EMI Music Group North America
and one takedown notice from EMI Entertainment World advising MP3tunes of
alleged instances of copyright infringement occurring on the Sideload Website
and Locker Website (the “Takedown Notices”).
(Proposed Joint Pretrial Order at 23, ¶ 9).
Further, the second paragraph of the Complaint that commenced this litigation, for
example, states flatly “MP3tunes engages in these acts of willful infringement through its
operations of two Internet websites, www.sideload.com and www.mp3tunes.com [which offers
the locker service].” (Compl. [Doc. No. 1] ¶ 2 (emphasis added)). The complaint goes on to
allege that
Through these websites, Defendant MP3tunes provides its users with an
integrated music service through which they can listen to music over their
computers, obtain permanent copies of music stored in online “lockers”
provided by MP3tunes, transfer music from their MP3tunes lockers to their
computers or other portable devices, and further distribute that music to others.
(Id. (emphasis added)).
Thus, as far as Robertson is aware, the legality of the MP3tunes locker service is still very much
in issue.
4

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

Filed 10/09/13 Page 8 of 12

Moreover, even if the MP3tunes’ locker service’s legality is no longer in dispute – which
itself is an astonishing concession by Plaintiffs – the Court may admit evidence “that does not
directly establish an element” of the claims. Williams, 2007 WL 3125314, at *4.
Simply put, it is not only disingenuous – but also hypocritical – for Plaintiffs to argue
now that the legality of the functionality of MP3tunes’ locker service in allowing users to store
lawfully obtained music ‘in the cloud’ is not and has never been an issue for the jury.” (Pl. Br. at
3 (emphasis added)). Even if this evidence “does not directly establish an element” of the
claims, Williams, 2007 WL 3125314, at *4, it should nevertheless be admitted as background
evidence. At the minimum, the jury would be extremely confused if they were told that the
Takedown Notice allegedly advised Defendants of “alleged instances of copyright infringement
occurring on” two websites, yet Robertson is only permitted to ever discuss only one of the
websites. (Exhibits C & D to the Declaration of Ira S. Sacks, dated October 9, 2013). The Court
thus should deny Plaintiffs’ request to prohibit Robertson from discussing locker services.1
II.

COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LOCKER SERVICE AND THE CLOUD
SERVICES WITH WHICH A JURY IS FAMILIAR HELPS THE JURY TO
UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY AT ISSUE
Plaintiffs also seek to prohibit Robertson from making any comparison between the

MP3tunes’ locker services and other services, such as iTunes, Dropbox, or Google Drive, with
which a jury would be more familiar. (See Pl. Br. at 4-5). As explained at the outset, this
position is frivolous. Plaintiffs are trying to prevent Robertson from effectively explaining to the
jury a technology that admittedly “would be unfamiliar to a jury” (Pl. Br. at 5) by making
comparisons to technology that – again in Plaintiffs’ words – would be “instantly familiar” to the
jury. (Id.). Drawing analogies between the unfamiliar technologies with the technologies that a
jury is likely to understand is a powerful pedagogical tool that can greatly help the jury to
1

Plaintiffs’ argument under Rule 403 is discussed in Point III below.
5

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

understand the technological issue.
First, despite Plaintiffs’ complaint, they do not dispute – nor can they dispute – that
MP3tunes’ locker service is just like that of Dropbox or Google Drive. At bottom, the locker
service permits a user to upload files over the internet to a remote server for storage;
subsequently, the user could download the uploaded file over the internet at any different
location.

This is precisely what Google Drive and Dropbox offer.

(See, e.g.,

http://www.google.com/drive/about.html (Google Drive permits a user to “[u]pload photos,
videos, documents, and other files that are important to you to Google Drive” and “[w]ith
[Google] Drive, your stuff goes where you go.”); https://www.dropbox.com/ (“Put your stuff in
Dropbox and get to it from your computers, phones, or tablets.”).
Indeed, Plaintiffs do not – and cannot – dispute that these popular services are similar to
MP3tunes’ locker services (users upload files to remote servers for future downloads at different
locations).
In addition, Plaintiffs are not taking a position that the services have different legal
ramifications. For example, Plaintiffs are not taking the position that if a user uploads an
unauthorized copy of a sound recording onto Dropbox or Google Drive, they would not consider
such an act immune from lawsuits by Plaintiffs. They simply fear that the jury may not find for
Plaintiffs against technologies the jurors like. (Pl. Br. at 5). Plaintiffs’ argument, if prevailed, is
to artificially deprive the jury of a powerful tool through which it could better understand the
relevant technologies.
Second, Plaintiffs decry that the jury could be unlikely to find for them if they knew that
it could hold the popular internet services liable for infringement. But this position is not very
different from the one that the industry group to which Plaintiffs belong took shortly before this

litigation commenced. Though the trial date will be in 2014, this case initiated in 2007. As
explained above, in February 2006, the RIAA submitted comments to the United States

example, took the position that “creating a back-up copy of a music CD is not a non-infringing
use,” because “the fact remains that there is no general exception to the reproduction right to
allow back-up copying.” (Id.). Thus, Plaintiffs’ industry group’s position was certainly that
backup copies, including backup copies uploaded onto sites such as MP3tunes, Google Drive, or
Dropbox, are infringing. Plaintiffs are simply trying to hide their positions from the jury, fearing
that it would find a hostile audience.
This is yet another reason why the Motion should be denied.
III.

REFERENCES TO THE LOCKER SERVICES AND COMPARISON TO CLOUD
SERVICES WILL HELP – NOT CONFUSE – THE JURY AND DOES NOT
UNFAIRLY PREJUDICE PLAINTIFFS
Plaintiffs also argue that Rule 403 prevents the references to either the locker services or

the comparison between the locker services and the well-known cloud storage services such as
Dropbox and Google Drive. (Pl. Br. at 4-5). They assert that these references would confuse the
jury and be unfairly prejudicial to them. Both arguments lack merit.
First, as shown above in Point I, MP3tunes’ locker service formed a part of key
background evidence. Based on Plaintiffs’ own allegations and statements since the beginning
of this case, it was an “integrated music service” through both the locker site and the sideloading
site that allegedly infringed copyrights. (Compl. ¶ 2). Robertson is entitled to introduce this
background evidence to give the jury a more complete picture of the facts of the case. This
would not confuse – but rather help – the jury to better assess the issues.
Second, as shown above in Point II, comparison between MP3tunes’ locker service and
7

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

Filed 10/09/13 Page 11 of 12

the popular cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox is a powerful pedagogical tool to
educate the jury on the background technology. Again, such a comparison would not confuse –
but would rather help – the jury to understand the technology. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not argue
that the technologies are different here; they simply fear that the jury would not find for them
because the jurors may personally use Google Drive or Dropbox. (Pl. br. at 5).
Finally, admitting both categories of evidence would not unfairly prejudice the jury.
Plaintiffs will argue – as they have in the past – that MP3tunes existed solely as a device to steal
and infringe. The jury must be allowed to hear both sides of that argument.
A district court performing Rule 403 analysis “must balance the probative value of the
evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion and considerations of undue
delay.” Morris v. Eversley, 2004 WL 856301, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2004). When Plaintiffs
ignored the relevance of both the locker service evidence and the helpfulness of comparison
between the locker service and the other better known cloud services, they have already failed to
perform the analysis properly.
Moreover, “[u]nder this rule, ‘damage to [Plaintiffs’] case is not a basis for excluding
probative evidence,’ because ‘[e]vidence that is highly probative invariably will be prejudicial to
the [opposing party].” United States v. Wallace, 124 F. App’x 165, 167 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting
United States v. Grimmond, 137 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir. 1998)). Unlike evidence that is unfairly
prejudicial, the evidence here is fair because it does not make “an appeal to emotion”, Wallace,
124 F. App’x at 167, or suggests that Plaintiffs “[are] bad [people] who [have] likely engaged in
other forms of misconduct for which [they] should be punished, regardless of the merits of this
case.” Katt v. City of New York, 151 F.Supp.2d 313, 360 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).
Plaintiffs also offered no reason why the adversarial process itself, through good

8

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 441

Filed 10/09/13 Page 12 of 12

advocacy and vigorous cross examination, could not clear up any potential prejudice or
confusion. See Carolina Canners, Inc. v. PBV Conway-Myrtle Beach, 2012 WL 2327777, at *2
(D.S.C. June 19, 2012) (“Potential confusion to the jury or prejudice to Plaintiff may be
addressed through cross-examination.”).

Indeed, exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 is

appropriate when the adversary system could not properly cure the use of evidence because
“the attempt to rebut the misleading inference is likely to lead the jury to infer that the evidence
is of greater probative worth than it truly is.” 22 Fed. Prac. & Pro., Evidence § 5217. That is
clearly not the case here.
IV.

THE REQUESTED RELIEF IS HOPELESSLY VAGUE
Finally, the requested relief is hopelessly vague. Plaintiffs request “an Order to preclude

argument regarding the legality of locker services and ‘cloud computing.’” (Notice of Motion
[Doc. No. 421] at 1). Read literally, that would prevent an argument that any of the challenged
conduct by Defendants was lawful. Such an overbroad request is baseless.
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Motion should be denied in its entirety.
