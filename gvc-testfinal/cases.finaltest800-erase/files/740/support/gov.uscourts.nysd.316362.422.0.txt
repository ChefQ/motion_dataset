UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
CAPITOL RECORDS, INC., et al,
No. 07 Civ. 9931 (WHP) (FM)
Plaintiffs,
ECF CASE
v.
MP3TUNES LLC and Michael Robertson,
Defendants.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE ARGUMENT REGARDING THE
LEGALITY OF LOCKER SERVICES AND CLOUD COMPUTING
Plaintiffs respectfully submit this memorandum of law in support of their motion in
limine to preclude Defendant Michael Robertson from introducing irrelevant and prejudicial
arguments regarding the legality of MP3tunes’ locker service and of “cloud computing” in
general, neither of which are issues properly set for trial.
BACKGROUND1
Consistently throughout more than five years of litigation, Defendants MP3tunes, LLC
and Michael Robertson (“Defendants”) have attempted to deflect focus from the clear
infringement they committed by injecting irrelevant issues into this litigation. One of
Defendants’ favored ploys has been to wrap themselves in the “flag” of technology and to argue
the case as though popular Internet activities were on trial, rather than Defendants’ liability for
discrete categories of copyright infringement.

Plaintiffs presume the Court’s familiarity with the procedural and factual background of this
action. In that regard, Plaintiffs provide a short summary of the relevant facts herein.

For example, at summary judgment, Defendants falsely implied that their own websites,
MP3tunes.com and sideload.com, were no different than uncontroversial and familiar services
like Apple’s iTunes, Google’s Gmail, and familiar technologies like search engines and cloud
computing.2 Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Summ. J., Oct. 29, 2010 (Dkt. No. 196) at 3-4, 6 (“Defs.’
Summ. J. Br.”). Defendants have also argued, both in this case, and in the public press, that
Plaintiffs were suing them for “allowing [users] to store their music in the cloud.” Id. at 1.
Such arguments are not only factually incorrect, but are also inapposite, irrelevant, and
prejudicial to Plaintiffs (and are intended to be so). The issues remaining for trial were defined
by this Court’s October 2011 summary judgment decision and May 2013 reconsideration
decision. The discrete categories of liability left for trial by those decisions leave no room for
arguments such as those addressed by this motion. See Oct. 25, 2011 Am. Mem. & Order (Dkt.
No. 276) (“Summ. J. Op.”); May 14, 2013 Mem. & Order (Dkt. No. 368) at 12 (“Recons. Op.”).
The remaining issues for trial consist of whether Robertson is liable for MP3tunes’
infringement3; whether MP3tunes is liable for the infringement caused when songs were
sideloaded by its executives and employees; Plaintiffs’ ownership (to the extent not already
proved at summary judgment) of specific songs Robertson personally sideloaded; whether
Defendants were willfully blind to infringement or had “red flag” knowledge of infringing content
(and if so, whether Defendants are secondarily liable for such content on their service); whether
Defendants’ use and storage of cover art was licensed; Plaintiffs’ ownership (to the extent not

While the definition of “cloud computing” is not settled, it is commonly understood to
encompass “the practice of storing regularly used computer data on multiple servers that can be
accessed through the Internet.” Merriam-Webster, “Cloud Computing,” http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/cloud%20computing (last accessed Sept. 18, 2013).

“Infringement” as used in this motion refers to infringement under the Copyright Act with
respect to musical compositions and sound recordings protected under the Act, and to commonlaw copyright infringement with respect to sound recordings fixed before 1972.

already proved at summary judgment) of songs as to which MP3tunes failed properly to
implement takedown notices; unfair competition as to pre-1972 works; and damages for these
various discrete categories of infringement liability. See Proposed Joint Pretrial Order (“JPTO”)
at 3-10. The legality of the functionality of MP3tunes’ locker service in allowing users to store
lawfully obtained music “in the cloud” is not and has never been an issue for the jury.
ARGUMENT
Through the use of a motion in limine, a party can “aid the trial process by enabling the
Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as to issues that
are definitely set for trial, without lengthy argument at, or interruption of, the trial.” Palmieri v.
Defaria, 88 F.3d 136, 141 (2d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted); see also Luce v. United States, 469
U.S. 38, 40 n.2 (1984); Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Schneider, 551 F. Supp. 2d 173, 176
(S.D.N.Y. 2008). The purpose of a motion in limine is to exclude irrelevant and inadmissible
evidence, especially where that evidence may prejudice a jury. In re Lawrence, No. 97-11258,
2008 WL 2095863, at *1 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. May 16, 2008). Even if evidence is relevant, it is
properly excluded “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more
of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,
wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Fed. R. Evid. 403.
Plaintiffs respectfully submit that Robertson’s likely renewal of his arguments regarding
the legality of the concept of cloud computing, which Plaintiffs do not here contest, would be
both confusing and prejudicial. As a result, as a prophylactic measure, this Court should
preclude any argument at trial regarding whether the “cloud computing” aspects of MP3tunes’
locker service are legal, as well as any accusations that Plaintiffs are seeking to make such
“cloud” storage of music illegal, for the reasons below.

First, Robertson’s pattern, throughout the history of this litigation, has been to look for
and create diversions from the true issues presented in this case by presenting extraneous,
irrelevant and manifestly prejudicial arguments. He did so in his motion for summary judgment
with straw man arguments regarding the legality of MP3tunes’ locker services,4 he did so (and
continues to do so) with respect to his theory that Plaintiffs abandoned or licensed their
copyrights,5 and he did so (and continues to do so) with respect to entirely permissible and
ordinary contacts between Plaintiffs’ counsel and his former employees.6 Because any
introduction of such arguments would be wholly irrelevant to the issues for trial, their
introduction would waste the Court’s time and distract from the questions that need to be
resolved in this case.
Second, Robertson is likely to repeat Defendants’ summary judgment argument about the
legality of MP3tunes’ locker services and cloud computing for the “benefit” of the jury,
especially the comparisons Defendants have drawn in the past between MP3tunes’ locker
services and well-known internet services like iTunes, Dropbox, and Google Documents. Defs.’
Summ. J. Br., at 3-4, 6. These arguments do not “rebut” any accusations that Plaintiffs will
make at trial. More importantly, they would risk confusing the jury by conflating the infringing
use of Defendants’ sideload.com website to copy songs from unauthorized websites (which is at
issue in this trial) with the use of Defendants’ mp3tunes.com website to let users store music
they have purchased or are otherwise may be licensed to store (which is not at issue). The jury
need not be required to wrestle with and separate these concepts. Indeed, Federal Rule of

Evidence 403 explicitly authorizes the exclusion of such evidence or argumentation that risks
confusing the issues. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.
Third, the risks of confusion and of prejudice are particularly high here, because the trial
involves many technical issues that would be unfamiliar to a jury, while, by contrast,
Robertson’s argument centers on brands and services like iTunes and Google that are instantly
familiar. The only potential purpose such arguments and misleading comparisons could serve is
to create the implication that if Plaintiffs prevail, these popular Internet services which make use
of cloud computing concepts—many of which jurors might personally use and have fond
impressions of—would be at risk.
Clearly, the very purpose of accusing Plaintiffs of trying to make popular cloud
computing services illegal is improperly to suggest that the jury reach such an inference and to
create emotional prejudice against Plaintiffs. United States v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d
Cir. 1980) (noting that the “prejudicial effect may be created by the tendency of the evidence . . .
to excite emotions against [a party]”). Thus, even if there were any minimal probative value to
this type of argument (which Plaintiffs dispute), it would be substantially outweighed by the risk
of prejudice to Plaintiffs. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.
CONCLUSION
The Court should not permit Robertson to insert irrelevant and confusing technical issues
into the upcoming trial. Thus, the Court should preclude any testimony or argument at trial
regarding the legality of online locker services or cloud computing, including any allegations that
Plaintiffs are seeking to prohibit such services as unlawful.
