CAPITOL RECORDS, INC., et al,
No. 07 Civ. 9931 (WHP) (FM)
Plaintiffs,
ECF CASE

V.
MP3TUNES LLC and MICHAEL ROBERTSON,
Defendants.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT ROBERTSON'S
MOTION IN LIMINE REGARDING THE ORDER OF PROOF AT TRIAL

Plaintiffs submit this memorandum of law in opposition to the motion of Defendant
Michael Robertson ("Robertson") requesting that the Court sever the trials against the two
defendants and prohibit any reference to the claims against MP3tunes during the trial against
Robertson. Tellingly, Robertson's motion is premised upon his statement that MP3tunes "will
default at trial." Unwittingly, this statement underscores that MP3tunes was always a shell for
Robertson's personal business plan and direction, and that the request to sever is a disingenuous
ploy to deprive Plaintiffs of the right to refer to the underlying infringing scheme for which they
seek to hold Robertson responsible.
The reason Robertson knows that MP3tunes will default is because he placed MP3tunes
into bankruptcy to delay this trial and to "stiff' his former counsel of fees. 1 Relying on this selfcreated default, Robertson's motion seeks to confuse the jury and thereby prejudice Plaintiffs by

1 The fact that even after the filing of the bankruptcy, when Robertson theoretically has no influence or
interest in MP3tunes, Robertson is still making unequivocal statements as to what MP3tunes will do only
further serve to buttress what Plaintiffs have been saying since the outset of the case but that Robertson
has continued (when it suits him) to dispute — that Robertson controls MP3tunes and always has.

preventing them from presenting a complete integrated case. Robertson's Orwellian attempt to
scrub any trace of his company's conduct from the trial against him borders on the surreal and
must be rejected.
Robertson first argues that the Court should sever the claims against MP3tunes from
those against him because the Court denied his motion for summary judgment with respect to
secondary or vicarious liability for the conduct of MP3tunes. See Robertson's Moving Brief at
pp. 1-2. Robertson is correct that the Court did find that issues of fact existed with regard to his
liability for MP3tunes' conduct. See Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 68793 *34 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2013) ("Whether Robertson was vicariously liable for the
contributory infringement of those songs that MP3tunes failed to remove upon receipt of
DMCA-compliant takedown notices was not before this Court in October 2011.... [T]here is a
genuine issue of material fact as to whether Robertson benefited from [MP3tunes1 infringement
in satisfaction of the common law vicarious liability standard."). However, Robertson's
argument that this ruling somehow mandates omitting reference to the claims against MP3tunes
at trial is nonsense. One of the primary purposes of the trial is to resolve those fact issues
relating to Robertson's secondary liability for MP3tunes' conduct that the Court directed would
be resolved at trial.
More specifically, the issues remaining to be tried in this case include whether Robertson,
by virtue of his control over every aspect of MP3tunes and its sideload.com website, is
secondarily liable for the infringing acts of MP3tunes. In order to establish Robertson's
secondary liability for MP3tunes' infringing acts, Plaintiffs need first establish that MP3tunes is,

in fact, liable for infringement. Some of MP3tunes' acts have already been established as
infringing, i.e., the failure to remove works from lockers after receipt of a DMCA notice. Others

have not, e.g., whether MP3tunes had red flag knowledge of or was willfully blind to the illegal
sideloading activities of its users. The resolution of these issues forms the basis for this trial.
MP3tunes' liability is a predicate to Robertson's secondary liability; the jury cannot decide the
latter without deciding the claims about the former.
Moreover, under the legal standards governing secondary liability, the questions
surrounding MP3tunes's liability and Robertson's are completely intertwined. Thus, it would be
impossible for the jury to assess Robertson's liability without also hearing about the underlying
wrongful conduct by MP3tunes that Plaintiffs claim he directed and participated in. Robertson
will be liable for MP3tunes's conduct if, inter alia, he was "personally and intimately involved
in many of the activities that form the basis of [MP3tunes'] copyright liability," which this Court
has held to be "an open question." Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 68793 *18, 38 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2013) (citing Arista Records LLC v. Usenet.com , Inc.,
633 F. Supp. 2d 124, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)). Accordingly, an assessment of whether Robertson
had the requisite level of involvement with and control over the actions for which MP3tunes is or
may be liable (e.g., failing to implement takedown notices properly, reproducing and displaying
Plaintiffs' cover art beyond the scope of any authorized license, and direct infringement by its
executives) necessarily requires the jury to hear about those acts of infringement and Robertson's
role in them. There is no intelligible way to separate the issues without depriving the jury of the
very evidence they need to assess Robertson's personal liability.
Robertson's motion relies upon the straw man argument that the anticipated default of
MP3tunes at trial mandates that the claims against MP3tunes be purged from the trial. This
argument is absurd and Robertson provides no support for it. Were MP3tunes to default,
Plaintiffs still need to establish its liability as a predicate to the claims against Robertson. To

3

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 446

Filed 10/09/13 Page 4 of 17

deprive Plaintiffs of the right to reference MP3tunes during the trial would deprive Plaintiffs of
the right to make their case against Robertson. Scrubbing the record clean of the entire factual
basis for Robertson's liability would be like trying to write a book about Charles Ponzi without
mention of his famous scheme.
Further, the history of this case shows that MP3tunes' bankruptcy — Robertson's rationale
for severing claims against it at trial — was an obvious tactical ploy by Robertson that was
intended, inter alia, to circumvent or delay his own liability. For example, when MP3tunes first
went into bankruptcy, Robertson requested a stay of this action to delay trial by claiming that the
bankruptcy required his attention, thereby admitting that which he had previously repeatedly
denied but which all of the evidence proved — that Robertson is the driving force behind
MP3tunes and the fount of all actions that it takes. As the Court noted in denying his motion:
Defendant Michael Robertson ('Robertson') seeks a stay of this copyright
infringement action in view of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by codefendant MP3tunes, LLC ('MP3tunes').... According to defense counsel,
Robertson is MP3tunes' chief executive officer and sole current employee....
Robertson has not shown any immediate adverse economic effect or
irreparable harm to the MP3tunes estate if this action continues against him.
See Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87718 *1-3 (S.D.N.Y. June

25, 2012). MP3tunes' bankruptcy also assisted Robertson in avoiding the fees incurred by the
law firm that represented him and MP3tunes in this litigation for many years, Duane Morris,
which is currently a creditor in the MP3tunes bankruptcy. See Dkt. 313 (Memorandum of Law
In Support of Duane Morris's Motion to Withdraw as Counsel); 12-06037-MM7, Doc 1-1 pg. 20
(Schedule of Creditors Holding Unsecured NonPriority Claims showing Duane Morris as a
$1,400,000 creditor of MP3tunes).
Strikingly, Robertson's motion is utterly inconsistent with the arguments that he made
when he requested a stay immediately following MP3tunes' bankruptcy. There he argued that
4

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 446

Filed 10/09/13 Page 5 of 17

MP3tunes' involvement in the trial was essential, and that if the action proceeded against him
without the presence of MP3tunes, MP3tunes would be prejudiced in that it would be denied the
right to participate in the defense of Plaintiffs' claims. See Exhibit A hereto, at 2-4 (arguing that
"Mr. Robertson's purported liability and any damages resulting from that purported liability are
directly related to and dependent upon Plaintiffs' case against MP3tunes," that "MP3tunes is
essential to any liability claims that Plaintiffs wish to pursue against Mr. Robertson," and that "it
is simply not possible to litigate Mr. Robertson's purported liability and any damages resulting
from that purported liability without placing MP3tunes directly in the cross hairs of Plaintiffs'
case in chief'). In rejecting the argument, the Court not only noted that the question of whether
the soon-defunct MP3tunes would be prejudiced is an "academic" one, it reaffirmed the "well
settled" principal that a plaintiff may sue as few (or as many) joint tortfeasor copyright infringers
as it chooses. Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87718 *4-5
(S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2012); see also Robbins Music Corp. v. Alamo Music, Inc., 119 F. Supp. 29,
31 (S.D.N.Y. 1954) ("It is hornbook law that an aggrieved party is not compelled to sue all tortfeasors. He may sue one or more or all of them, at his discretion.").
Robertson also argues that Plaintiffs will suffer no prejudice if MP3tunes defaults
because Plaintiffs have no right to a jury trial of their claims against MP3tunes. However, the
prejudice Plaintiffs will suffer if the Court prohibits reference to MP3tunes at trial will not be
from the inability to try Plaintiffs' claims against MP3tunes, but rather the inability to present the
factual predicate for Robertson's liability. Accordingly, Robertson's citation to Dollar Sys., Inc.
v. Avcar Leasing Sys., Inc., 890 F.2d 165, 170 (9th Cir. 1989) is wholly inapposite. That case

stands for the unremarkable proposition that "where there are issues common to both the
equitable and legal claims, the legal claims involved in the action must be determined prior to

5

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 446

Filed 10/09/13 Page 6 of 17

any final court determination of [the] equitable claims." In Dollar, the district court exercised its
discretion to bifurcate the trial and try the counterclaimant's rescission claim to the court prior to
having the jury decide the plaintiffs legal claims, because rescission "is an equitable remedy . .
for which no right to a jury exists." Id. Here, the copyright infringement claims against both
Robertson and MP3tunes are legal claims. Moreover, that case is factually inapposite because in
Dollar "there [were] no common issues of law and fact between the two distinct set of claims to

be tried." Wechsler v. Hunt Health Sys., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13775, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 7,
2003); Dollar Sys., Inc., 890 F.2d at 170-71. Here, by definition, the factual basis for MP3tunes'
liability forms the predicate for Robertson's secondary liability.
Robertson also cites a case from the Northern District of Florida, Johnson v. Mortham,
915 F.Supp. 1574, 1581 (N.D. Fla. 1996), for the unchallenged but inapplicable proposition that
"a trial court has broad discretion to exercise control over the order of presentation at trial," in
order to support his argument that counsel should be prohibited from referencing the claims
against MP3tunes at trial. However, in Johnson, a constitutional equal protection clause case,
the Court found that because the Defendants had the burden of production on an issue — which
was "very much akin to an affirmative defense" — it would not be error to allow them to present
their evidence first at trial.

Id. at 1579, 1582.

Johnson has no bearing whatsoever on

Robertson's motion. Also notable was the Court in Johnson's concern that lilf the trial of this
matter were before a jury, there would be some risk that altering the order of presentation might
confuse the jury as to which party bears the ultimate burden of persuasion." Id. at 1582 at n. 6.
Jury confusion would plainly result here were Plaintiffs precluded from referring to the acts of
MP3tunes for which they seek to hold Robertson secondarily liable.

At bottom, Robertson's motion with regard to order of proof, like several of his other
motions in limine (most of which are not really motions in limine at all but are motions for
reconsideration of facts already established and legal determinations already made, or disguised
motions for summary judgment), is an effort to prevent the jury from hearing the whole story
about Robertson, his infringing service, and his motives for operating it. It is also yet another
attempt to use to his tactical advantage his thin capitalization of MP3tunes and his election to put
it into bankruptcy once the Court ruled that this case was trial ready. The full strategic plan
underlying this request is revealed by Robertson's request that this Court direct Plaintiffs to try
their secondary liability case against Robertson without reference to MP3tunes so that "[a]fter
the verdicts are returned with respect to the claims against Robertson, the Court can decide the
claims against MP3tunes in light of the verdicts on the claims against Robertson." Robertson's
Moving Brief at p. 2. If accepted, Plaintiffs would be required to present a case against
Robertson first without being able to tell the story of the underlying infringing enterprise.
Thereafter, MP3tunes's own fate would ride piggyback on the outcome of Robertson's
incomplete and prejudicial trial. The prejudice and abuse of justice that would result from such a
tortured trial process is manifest. Robertson's motion must be summarily denied.
CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion in limine regarding the order of proof at
trial should be denied.

Capitol Records, LLC et al. v. MP3tunes, Inc. et ano
No. 07 Civ. 9931 (WHP)

Dear Judge Pauley:
We represent the defendants in the above-referenced litigation (the "Litigation").
Pursuant to the Court's Order dated May 14, 2012, defendant Michael Robertson submits the
following request for a stay of the Litigation against him in light of the filing of a bankruptcy
petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California (the
"Bankruptcy Court") by defendant MP3tunes, Inc. ("MP3tunes") currently before the Honorable
Judge Margaret M. Mann (the "Bankruptcy Case"). See In re MP3tunes, Inc., Bankr. No. 1206037-MM7 (Bankr. C.D. Cal., May 14, 2012).
The Litigation against Mr. Robertson should be stayed for the following reasons, all of
which are discussed more fully below: (1) the Litigation against MP3tunes, a necessary party, is
currently stayed by virtue of section 362 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy
Code"); (2) the Bankruptcy Trustee should have a reasonable opportunity to analyze the impact
of the claims made against Mr. Robertson on MP3tunes and the bankruptcy estate before the
Litigation should be permitted to continue against Mr. Robertson; and (3) pursuant to sections
362 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Code, this Court should stay the Litigation against Mr.
Robertson.

MP3tunes Is Necessary to the Litigation

First, MP3tunes is a necessary party to the Litigation because Mr. Robertson's purported
liability and any damages resulting from that purported liability are directly related to and
dependent upon Plaintiffs' case against MP3tunes. For example, Your Honor has already
granted Plaintiffs' request to file a motion for reconsideration of this Court's October 16, 2009
order dismissing Plaintiffs' copyright inducement claim and of this Court's October 25, 2011
order granting in part, MP3tunes' motion for summary judgment that the safe harbors of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") immunize MP3tunes from Plaintiffs' infringement
claims with respect to all but a limited set of songs. Both of these decisions address claims
brought against MP3tunes. Indeed, Plaintiffs' copyright inducement claim alleges that
MP3tunes induced its users to commit copyright infringement. Yet the allegations supporting
the inducement claim in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, the "listing" and "advertising"
of content, hinge on MP3tunes' conduct, not Mr. Robertson's conduct. See Dkt. # 121 at if 119094. Further, Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of their summary judgment motion decided by Your
Honor's October 25, 2011 order but Plaintiffs never moved for summary judgment against Mr.
Robertson. Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion was directed solely at MP3tunes. See Dkt. #
186 (Plaintiffs seeking "summary judgment defendant (sic) MP3tunes on claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7,
and 8); see also Dkt. 182 ("briefmg with respect to all issues relating to Mr. Robertson's personal
liability will be raised with the Court, if necessary, after a determination of the liability of
MP3tunes"). Indeed, as indicated by Plaintiffs' letter to the Court dated April 18, 2012,
Plaintiffs intend to allege that the DMCA does not apply to MP3tunes (rather than Mr.
Robertson) because it was supposedly "willfully blind" and had "red flag" knowledge of its
users' activities. Plaintiffs' unfair competition claim applies solely to MP3tunes as Mr.
Robertson as an individual cannot possibly be in competition with Plaintiffs. See Dkt. 121 at
114-118. Accordingly, these are clearly issues that cannot be litigated without MP3tunes.
However, these issues cannot currently be litigated against MP3tunes because all actions
against MP3tunes, including the Litigation, are currently stayed pursuant to section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, because of the essential role of MP3tunes in the litigation of
Plaintiffs' claims as summarized above, the Litigation against Mr. Robertson should also be
stayed until such time as the Bankruptcy Court may grant relief from the stay of the Litigation
against MP3tunes.
The Bankruptcy Trustee Needs Time to Review the Claims
Second, the Litigation against Mr. Robertson should be stayed because the Bankruptcy
Trustee, Gerald H. Davis, should be given an opportunity to familiarize himself with the
Litigation and analyze any impact that the Litigation could have on the bankruptcy estate of
MP3tunes should the Litigation proceed against Mr. Robertson. Mr. Davis was just recently
appointed as the Bankruptcy Trustee and, in that regard, has not even conducted a section 341
meeting of creditors in the Bankruptcy Case, let alone meet and confer with Mr. Robertson
regarding the Litigation and MP3tunes' defenses to the claims asserted therein. Permitting the

The Hon. William H. Pauley III

Litigation to continue against Mr. Robertson at this early juncture of the Bankruptcy Case could
severely prejudice MP3tunes and the bankruptcy estate.

III. A Stay Against All Parties is Warranted Under sections 362(a) and 105
Third, and finally, the Litigation against Mr. Robertson should be stayed based on the
protections provided under either section 362(a) or section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
continuance of the claims against Mr. Robertson is proper as MP3tunes is the real party
defendant and because continuation of the Litigation endangers MP3tunes' estate and its
creditors. See Desouza v. Plusfunds Group, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.) (district
courts have jurisdiction to determine whether a stay can apply to nondebtor defendants);
Hounddog Productions LLC v. Empire Film Group, Inc., et al., 767 F. Supp. 2d 480, 485
(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (district court determining whether automatic stay applied to nondebtor
defendants).

A.

Under Section 362(a), Courts Apply An Automatic Stay to Non-Debtor
Defendants if a Continuance of the Claims against the Non-debtor
Defendants Endangers the Debtor's Estate

The automatic stay of section 362(a)(1) prohibits the "commencement or continuation . . .
of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could
have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a
claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under [the Bankruptcy
Code]." 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1). Under section 362(a), an automatic stay applies to non-bankrupt
defendants "when a claim against the non-debtor will have an immediate adverse economic
consequence for the debtor's estate." Queenie, Ltd. v. Nygard Int?, 321 F.3d 282, 287 (2d Cir.
2003) (affirming application of automatic stay under 362(a) to non-debtor codefendant). "The
threatened harm may be to needed debtor funds (e.g., when non-debtors are entitled to
indemnification) or personnel (e.g., when debtors need the services of non-debtors facing
crushing litigation)," Gray v. Hirsch (In re Gray), 230 B.R. 239, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), or, for
example, "where 'there is such identity between the debtor and the third-party defendant that the
debtor may be said to be the real party defendant. . . ." Queenie, 321 F.3d at 288 (quoting .A.H.
Robins Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F.2d 994, 999 (4th Cir. 1986)).

B.

A Stay Is Proper Because MP3tunes, Not Mr. Robertson, is the Real Party
Defendant

MP3turies is essential to any liability claims that Plaintiffs wish to pursue against Mr.
Robertson. As pointed out above regarding the necessary nature of MP3tunes to the Litigation, it
is simply not possible to litigate Mr. Robertson's purported liability and any damages resulting
from that purported liability without placing MP3tunes directly in the cross hairs of Plaintiffs'

case in chief, in disregard of the automatic stay imposed by section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code.
C.

A Stay Is Warranted Against All Parties Because Proceeding with the
Litigation Against Mr. Robertson Will Harm the 1VFP3tunes Estate and its
Creditors

Courts in this circuit and elsewhere have extended the automatic stay provided by section
362(a) to non-debtor codefendants where there may be harm to debtor funds or personnel. For
example, in the case In Re North Star Contracting Corp. v. McSpedon, 125 B.R. 368, 370-371
(S.D.N.Y. 1991), the court granted an expansion of the section362(a)(1) stay to a non-bankrupt
president of the debtor because "a judgment against the non-debtor will affect directly the
debtor's assets." Id. In its holding, the court reasoned that the stay should apply to the president
of the debtor because, inter alia, he is a "principal player" in the bankruptcy process. Id. at 371.
See also In re Rustic Manufacturing, Inc., 55 Bankr. 25,31 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 1985) (stay
applied to non-debtor principals who performed most of the debtor's business); In re Northlake
Building Partners, 41 Bankr. 231, 233 (Bankr. N.D. 111. 1984) (stay applied to non-debtor
principals responsible for management of the debtor's business).
If the Litigation against Mr. Robertson is not stayed, Mr. Robertson would face crushing
litigation demands that would harm the MP3tunes estate and its creditors. As Chief Executive
Officer of MP3tunes, Mr. Robertson's role in MP3tunes' Chapter 7 process is integral and
irreplaceable. Mr. Robertson must aid the Bankruptcy Trustee in taking inventory of MP3tunes'
assets, including not only its physical equipment but also any intellectual property belonging to
MP3tunes. For example, the Bankruptcy Trustee will have to determine whether MP3tunes
owns any proprietary trade secrets and whether those trade secrets have been adequately
maintained. The Bankruptcy Trustee will also have to determine whether MP3tunes owns
proprietary software, whether such software was adequately protected by work-for-hire
provisions in employment contracts, and whether such software was developed by independent
contractors with adequate assignments. For proprietary software co-developed or jointly
developed with third parties, the Bankruptcy Trustee will need to determine which components
of the software belong to MP3tunes. Where the proprietary software is derived from or
incorporates third-party software, such as open source software, this is also true. The
Bankruptcy Trustee will need to prepare detailed schedules of third-party ownership of any
proprietary software incorporated in the technology, as well as any licenses granted by MP3tunes
and the scope and assignment of such licenses. This will require knowledge of MP3tunes'
software, technology and its corporate history. The Bankruptcy Trustee will need to prepare the
representations and warranties as to these assets. As the last remaining employee at MP3tunes,
only Mr. Robertson can aid the Bankruptcy Trustee in these matters. In addition, Mr. Robertson
must be available to potential buyers to answer questions they may have about those assets and
must provide assistance in negotiating the fair value of the assets so that the MP3tunes estate can
best satisfy the debts of its creditors. Thus, the MP3tunes estate and its creditors will be greatly

harmed if Mr. Robertson is unable to devote his undivided attention to his responsibilities to
bankruptcy process.
Denial of the stay will substantially impair Mr. Robertson's ability to perform his
essential role in the bankruptcy process. Throughout this entire Litigation, Mr. Robertson played
a central role in gathering facts, documents, and other information and developing strategies in
this case. For example, in order to respond to Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration on the issue
of MP3tunes' supposed knowledge of its users activities, Mr. Robertson will be needed to
provide factual background. Immediately following the parties' motions for reconsideration,
there will be pre-trial demands followed by the demands of trial. Indeed, Mr. Robertson will
certainly be called as a witness throughout the trial. Not staying the Litigation would mean that
Mr. Robertson's duties to the MP3tunes estate would have to compete with his right to defend
himself in the Litigation.
In order to protect the MP3tunes estate and its creditors, the Court should stay the
Plaintiffs' claims against Mr. Robertson under section 362(a).

D.

A Stay is Proper Under Section 105

Under section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code, "'[t]he court may issue any order, process, or
judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title." In re
Chateaugay, 93 B.R. 26, 30 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 105(a)). "Pursuant to their
authority under § 105, courts have stayed actions against non-debtor third parties where they
have found that the estate will be adversely affected. . . because the action would detract from
the invaluable time and attention the non-debtor third party would otherwise devote to the
continued operation of the debtor's business or the reorganization effort, or because the claims
against the non-debtor third parties are really claims against the debtor and therefore impair the
automatic stay." In re Third Eighty-Ninth Assoc., 138 B.R. 144, 147 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). While
section 105 essentially offers injunctive relief, courts do not follow the traditional analysis for
injunctive relief. See Garrity v. Leffler (In re Neuman), 71 B.R. 567, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)
(holding "[s]ince injunctions in bankruptcy cases are authorized by statute, the usual equitable
grounds for relief, such as irreparable damage, need not be shown."); Keene Corp. v. Coleman
(In re Keene Corp.), 164 B.R. 844, 849 (Bank:T. S.D.N.Y. 1994) ("[u]nder Section 105, however,
a debtor need not show irreparable harm").
To differentiate the extension of the automatic stay to non-debtor defendants under
section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code from the extension of the automatic stay under section
105, courts have held that section 105 is "broader than the automatic stay provisions of section
362(a)," In re Baldwin-United Corp. Litig., 765 F.2d 343, 348 (2d Cir. 1985), and supports the
issuance of an injunction for parties who do not fall within the scope of section 362(a). See In re
Chateaugay, 93 B.R. 26, 30 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (extending a stay pursuant to section 105 despite
the inapplicability of section 362); Queenie, 321 F.3d 282 at 287 ("Section 105 of the
Bankruptcy Code [] grants broader authority"); Rosetta Res. Operating LP v. Pogo Producing

1.

An Extension of the Stay Under Section 105 is Warranted Where, as
here, Proceeding with Claims Detract from the Nondebtor
Defendant's Attention to the Debtor Estate

As with section 362(a), courts use section 105 to extend an automatic stay where
continued litigation against the corporate officer would detract from the officer's attention to the
debtor estate. See Sec. Investor Prot. Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 443 B.R. 295,
316 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2011) (employing section 105 to extend section 362 stay to third-party
actions against nondebtor entities against whom third-party actions "will have an immediate
adverse economic consequence for the debtor's estate" because employees who are "thus central
to the Trustee's investigation" would have to devote time to the litigation); Nevada Power
Company v. Calpine Corp. (In re Calpine Corp.), 365 B.R. 401, 413 (S.D.N.Y March 28, 2007)
(same); In re Alert Holdings, 148 B.R. 194, 200 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992) ("Where there is a
showing that the action sought to be enjoined would embarrass, burden, delay or otherwise
impede the reorganization proceedings or if the stay is necessary to preserve or protect the
debtor's estate and reorganization prospects, the Bankruptcy Court may issue injunctive relief.");
In re Ionosphere Clubs Inc., 124 B.R. 635, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (affirming extension of stay
under section 105 to nondebtor co-defendants where the "drain on key officers' time and energy.
. . could frustrate . . . efforts at formulating a fair and equitable plan"); Johns-Manville Corp., 26
B.R. 420, 429 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1983) (employing section 105 to extend automatic stay to key
employees of debtor defendants because it would distract them from their obligations to the
estate). Indeed, while recognizing that irreparable harm was not necessary to a section 105
analysis, the district court in In re Lomas Financial Corp., 117 B.R. 64 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), agreed
that, if the creditors' actions were sustained, "key Lomas personnel" would be "distracted from
participating" in the bankruptcy process and that such a distraction would "cause[] Lomas and its
creditors both immediate and irreparable harm." Id. at 67 (emphasis added).
Accordingly, as demonstrated above, because a continuation of Plaintiffs' Litigation
against Mr. Robertson would distract him from his duties to the MP3tunes estate and its
creditors, an extension of the automatic stay is proper under section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Staying Plaintiffs' Litigation against Mr. Robertson will not cause any harm to Plaintiffs
but rather preserves the status quo. Plaintiffs would be no worse off at a future date than they are
now. Accordingly, the Court should grant a stay of the litigation against Mr. Robertson under
section 105.

An Extension of the Stay Under Section 105 is Warranted Where, as
here, a Continuance Poses the Potential Threat of Collateral Estoppel
to Nondebtor Defendants

In addition, Courts have also employed section 105 to extend the automatic stay to
nondebtor defendants where there is the danger of collateral estoppel. See Rosetta Res.
Operating LP v. Pogo Producing Co. (In re Calpine Corp.), 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 2025, at *12*13 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2007) (extending stay for estoppel reasons); Nevada Power
Company v. Calpine Corp. (In re Calpine Corp.), 365 B.R. 401, 413 (S.D.N.Y 2007) (same);
Hawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v. Calpine Corp. (In re Calpine Corp.), 2006
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92499, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2006) (same); In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc.,
111 B.R. 423, 434 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1990) (extending stay because "a finding of liability as to
the debtor] Eastern's codefendants may be extended to Eastern and collateral estoppel may bar
Eastern from litigating factual and legal issues critical to its defense."); In re Lomas Financial
Corp., 117 B.R. 64, 67 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (affirming stay because of collateral estoppel concerns);
In re Johns-Manville, 26 B.R. 420 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1983), vacated on other grounds 41 B.R.
916 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (staying litigation against officers and directors based in part on collateral
estoppel).
Courts also have extended the automatic stay to joint tortfeaser co-defendants in
copyright infringement cases. See Queenie, 321 F.3d at 287 (extending stay in copyright
infringement action); Roberts v. We Love County Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18566, at *6-*9
(E.D. Pa. Aug 29, 2005) (extending the automatic stay to solvent co-defendants facing copyright
infringement claims).
Indeed, the danger of estoppel to MP3tunes is particularly acute given the fact that
MP3tunes is liquidating under Chapter 7. An entity does not cease to exist following liquidation
under Chapter 7 and may be sued. The case Jackson v. CorporateGear, LLC, 2005 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 35579, at *12-*13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2005), is instructive:
[I]n a Chapter 7 case, a corporate debtor cannot be discharged. As
the Second Circuit has observed, 'Congress deliberately excluded
corporations from eligibility for discharge under Chapter 7 to
avoid trafficking in corporate shells and in bankrupt partnerships.'
Moreover, the Chapter 7 proceedings do not dissolve a
corporation, and unless the corporation is dissolved under state
law, the corporation continues to exist and is subject to liability.
Hence, if a claim against a debtor corporation was not
administered in the Chapter 7 proceeding, it survives and can be
pursued after the Chapter 7 case is closed.

Plaintiffs' claims against MP3tunes are not extinguished following its Chapter 7
proceedings. Thus, the collateral estoppel concerns at issue in the above cases apply equally to
MP3tunes. The claims against Mr. Robertson and MP3tunes are identical. Pursuit of the
Litigation against Mr. Robertson will prejudice MP3tunes' future defense against identical
claims concerning the same set of facts. Permitting the Litigation to continue against Mr.
Robertson would obviously prejudice MP3tunes because collateral estoppel may bar MP3tunes
from re-litigating the facts and legal issues critical to its defense. It should be noted that at trial
Plaintiffs intend to pursue liability beyond the works subject to the Court's October 25, 2011
order, in addition to any purported damages resulting from the alleged infringement of those
works. MP3tunes should not be subject to a finding of liability or damages that may be decided
as to Mr. Robertson without being able to defend itself. Enabling Plaintiffs to pursue their
claims against Mr. Robertson while the automatic stay is in effect against MP3tunes would allow
Plaintiffs to effectively undermine the legislative intent of section 362(a).
Accordingly, we respectfully request a stay of the Litigation against Mr. Robertson for a
period of 90 days following which this Court could revisit all of the issues raised herein and
determine whether an additional stay is necessary and appropriate.
We thank the Court for its consideration.
Respectfully submitted,

Gregory P. Gulia
