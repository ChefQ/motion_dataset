07 Civ. 9931 (WHP)

DEFENDANT ROBERTSON’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HIS
MOTION IN LIMINE REGARDING THE ORDER OF PROOF AT TRIAL
Defendant Michael Robertson (“Robertson”) submits this memorandum of law in support
of his motion in limine regarding the order of proof at trial. Claims against MP3tunes, LLC
(“MP3tunes”) should be severed from claims against Robertson and decided by the Court after
the claims against Robertson. Moreover, no reference to the claims against MP3tunes should be
permitted during the trial against Robertson.
The reason for such relief is simple. MP3tunes is in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and will
default at trial. As a result, the claims against MP3tunes must be decided by the Court on a
motion for default.
Trial of the claims against MP3tunes should not be permitted to infect the proceedings
against Robertson, especially since this Court denied Robertson’s motion for summary judgment
with respect to Robertson’s potential secondary and/or vicarious liability for any damage claims
against MP3tunes. Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 2013 WL 1987225, at *9-11 (May
14, 2013). Robertson would be seriously prejudiced if Plaintiffs are permitted the illusion of
trying their claims against MP3tunes at the same time that they are actually trying their claims
against Robertson. In essence, “MP3tunes” will be providing no rebuttal to Plaintiffs’ claims
and evidence and such matter will be viewed by the jury as uncontested.

This Court plainly has power to sever the claims against MP3tunes and have those claims
decided after the jury decides the claims against Robertson. See Johnson v. Mortham, 915
F.Supp. 1574, 1581 (N.D. Fla. 1996) (“it is also well established that a trial court has broad
discretion to exercise control over the order of presentation at trial”); accord Fed. R. Evid. 611(a)
(“The court should exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses
and presenting evidence”).
Nor is there any prejudice from such a procedure. As noted above, Plaintiffs have no
right to a jury determination of the claims against MP3tunes since MP3tunes will default. Offei
v. Omar, 2011 WL 4448954, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2011) (“the overwhelming weight of
case-law authority holds that a default based on inaction by the defendant deprives all parties of
any preexisting right to a jury”).1 After the verdicts are returned with respect to the claims
against Robertson, the Court can decide the claims against MP3tunes in light of the verdicts on
the claims against Robertson.
CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion in limine regarding the order of proof at
trial should be granted.

In fact, the right to a jury trial suggests that Robertson’s case must proceed before claims
against MP3tunes were to be resolved. Accord Dollar Sys., Inc. v. Avcar Leasing Sys., Inc., 890
F.2d 165, 170 (9th Cir. 1989) (“where there are issues common to both the equitable and legal
claims, the legal claims involved in the action must be determined prior to any final court
determination of [the] equitable claims”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
