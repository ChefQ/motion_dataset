Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1110 Filed 05/07/13 Page 2 of 7

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant, The SCO Group, Inc. (“SCO”), respectfully submits
this Memorandum in support of its motion for reconsideration of the Court’s order denying
SCO’s Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No. 1109) (the “Order”). The Court denied the
Motion on the grounds that it would be inefficient and potentially problematic to proceed without
IBM’s counterclaims, concluding: “Accordingly, the court declines to reopen the case at this
time. When the bankruptcy stay is lifted, either party may file a motion to reopen the case. Until
then, the case shall remain administratively closed.” (Order at 2.)
SCO submits that reconsideration is appropriate because the Bankruptcy Court
overseeing SCO’s bankruptcy proceedings lifted the stay of IBM’s counterclaims in February
2012 and IBM agreed to the reopening of the case should that stay be lifted. The Bankruptcy
Court order lifting the stay was previously submitted to the Court with SCO’s Request to Submit
for Decision, on June 14, 2012. (Exs. A and B.) Accordingly, SCO respectfully asks the Court
to reconsider its decision and grant the Motion to Reopen the Case forthwith.
BACKGROUND
1.

On November 4, 2011, SCO filed its Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No.

1095) (the “Motion to Reopen”) in order to proceed with its remaining unfair competition and
tortious interference claims. Those claims, which the Chapter 7 Trustee overseeing SCO’s
bankruptcy estate deems meritorious, are the only remaining assets of SCO’s bankruptcy estate.
2.

On November 21, 2011, Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff International Business

Machines Corporation (“IBM”) filed its opposition to the Motion to Reopen (Docket No. 1100).
4

Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1110 Filed 05/07/13 Page 3 of 7

(Ex. C.) Even though the Bankruptcy Code had automatically stayed all of IBM’s counterclaims
against SCO without disturbing SCO’s right to pursue its claims against IBM, IBM opposed the
Motion to Reopen on the grounds that litigating SCO’s claims without IBM’s counterclaims
“would be inefficient and fundamentally unfair.” (Id. at 1.)
3.

Accordingly, IBM asserted that the Court “should reopen the case when the

stay has been lifted as to IBM’s counterclaims.” (Id. at 6 (emphasis in original).) In fact, IBM
argued for an order “providing that this case shall be reopened within 5 days of the filing of a
notice (by any party) that the stay of IBM’s counterclaims has been lifted.” (Id. at 14, ¶ 39.)
4.

On February 16, 2012, SCO and IBM stipulated in SCO’s bankruptcy

proceedings to modify the automatic stay of IBM’s counterclaims so as to “permit IBM” to
“defend the Utah action and prosecute its Counterclaims against SCO.” (Ex. B at 4, ¶ 2.) As
part of that stipulation, IBM also agreed that “IBM shall not oppose the reopening of the Utah
Action.” (Id. at 5, ¶ 4 (emphasis added).)
5.

On February 17, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the

stipulation and modifying the automatic stay “as set forth” in the stipulation. (Id. at 1.)
6.

On June 14, 2012, after the Motion to Reopen had been pending for over six

months, SCO filed its Request to Submit for Decision (Docket No. 1100) (the “Request”), which
included as an exhibit the bankruptcy order and stipulation lifting the stay of IBM’s
counterclaims (Docket No. 1107-1). (Exs. A and B.) The Request asked the Court to rule on the
pending Motion to Reopen, particularly in light of the bankruptcy order and stipulation, which
had rendered the Motion unopposed. (Ex. A at 3.)

4

7.

The Request also informed the Court of the Bankruptcy Court’s order lifting the

stay of IBM’s counterclaims “as set forth” in the stipulation, including IBM’s agreement “not
[to] oppose the reopening of the Utah Action.” (Ex. A at 2, ¶ 6.) SCO thus provided the
“notice” that, according to IBM, warranted an order “providing that this case shall be reopened
within 5 days of the filing of a notice (by any party) that the stay of IBM’s counterclaims has
been lifted.”
8.

On April 24, 2013, the Court entered its Memorandum Decision and Order

Denying Motion to Reopen Case (Docket No. 1109) (the “Order”). While the Order recognized
that IBM’s response to the Motion to Reopen “opposes reopening the case until the bankruptcy
stay of its counterclaims is lifted so that SCO’s claims and IBM’s counterclaims may be litigated
together” (Order at 2), the Order did not mention that the stay had in fact been lifted. (Id. at 1-2)
9.

Instead, the Order denied the Motion to Reopen the Case, concluding:

“Accordingly, the court declines to reopen the case at this time. When the bankruptcy stay is
lifted, either party may file a motion to reopen the case. Until then, the case shall remain
administratively closed.” (Id. at 2.)
ARGUMENT
“A district court has discretionary power to revise interlocutory orders at any time before
the entry of final judgment.” Hemminger v. Beam, 2013 WL 1707700, at *1 (W.D. Okla. April
19, 2013); see Warren v. American Bankers Ins., 507 F.3d 1239, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007); Sump v.
Fingerhut, Inc., 208 F.R.D. 324, 327 (D. Kan. 2002). Upon a motion for reconsideration, relief
is appropriate “where the court has misapprehended the facts, a party’s position, or the

4

Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1110 Filed 05/07/13 Page 5 of 7

controlling law.” Servants of the Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000);
Carter v. Bigelow, 869 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1330 (D. Utah 2012).
Here, the Court denied the Motion to Reopen the Case based on a misapprehension of the
status of the Bankruptcy stay, which the Court understood to remain in effect. In fact, as SCO
informed the Court in June 2012 in the Request to Submit for Decision, the Bankruptcy Court
lifted the stay on February 17, 2012, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties. (Exs. A and B.)
Accordingly, reconsideration is appropriate and the Court should grant the Motion to Reopen.
In addition, IBM already agreed to the reopening of the case in the event that the
Bankruptcy Court lifted the stay. Even in its response to the Motion to Reopen, IBM agreed that
the Court should “reopen the case when the stay has been lifted” and argued for an order
“providing that this case shall be reopened within 5 days of the filing of a notice (by any party)
that the stay of IBM’s counterclaims has been lifted.” (Ex. C at 6, 14.) Subsequently, IBM
secured the lifting of the stay in the Bankruptcy Court by stipulating “not [to] oppose the
reopening of the Utah Action.” (Ex. B at 5, ¶ 4.)
Should the Court now grant the Motion to Reopen, SCO respectfully submits that the
Court would benefit from oral argument on the unresolved summary judgment motions, which
have been pending since 2006, and respectfully requests that the Court schedule such argument.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should reconsider its decision and grant SCO’s
Motion to Reopen the Case.
