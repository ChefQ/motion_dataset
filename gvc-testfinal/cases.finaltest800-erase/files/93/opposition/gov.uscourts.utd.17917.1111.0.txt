Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant,
IBM’S MEMORANDUM RESPONDING TO
SCO’S REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION

v.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES
CORPORATION,
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff.

17225736.1

Civil No. 2:03-CV-0294-DN
Honorable David Nuffer

Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1111 Filed 05/24/13 Page 2 of 4

Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff International Business Machines Corporation
(“IBM”) respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the request of The SCO Group,
Inc. (“SCO”) (n/k/a TSG Group, Inc.) for reconsideration (Docket No. 1110) of the Court’s order
denying SCO’s motion to reopen the case (Docket No. 1109).
Argument
1.

IBM does not oppose reopening this case, as a final judgment has been

entered against SCO in the Novell Litigation (see SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Case No. 2:04-cv139; The SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., 439 Fed. Appx. 688 (10th Cir. 2011) (“the Novell
Judgment”)), the bankruptcy stay has been lifted (see Docket No. 1110 at Ex. B), and the Court
may now proceed to adjudicate all of the claims in suit.
2.

However, IBM takes a different view from SCO as to how the Court

should proceed when the case is reopened. Rather than undertake immediately to decide the
numerous outstanding motions, we respectfully submit that the Court should proceed as is
described in IBM’s Memorandum Responding to SCO’s Request to Reopen, filed November 21,
2011 (Docket No. 1100), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
3.

Specifically, when the case is reopened, IBM believes the Court should

first dismiss the claims that SCO concedes are foreclosed as a result of the Novell Litigation.
SCO admits that at least five (and perhaps six) of its claims against IBM, and part of another of
its claims, are foreclosed by the Novell Judgment. (See Ex. A ¶¶ 28-29 for a fuller discussion.)
4.

Because the parties disagree as to the effect of the Novell Litigation on

other claims, IBM proposes to make a motion for summary judgment addressing the impact of
the Novell Judgment on all remaining claims (including IBM’s counterclaims). If we are correct

17225736.1

Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1111 Filed 05/24/13 Page 3 of 4

about the impact of the Novell Judgment, it will be unnecessary for the Court to decide a number
of the pending summary judgment motions to resolve these claims.
5.

Once the Court has determined the effect of the Novell Judgment, we

propose the Court require the parties to submit a scheduling order to govern the balance of this
action. If the Court were to deny the summary judgment motion that IBM proposes to make
concerning the impact of the Novell Judgment, then it would be necessary for the Court to wade
into the pending summary judgment motions concerning those claims. But before doing so, it
will likely be advisable (depending in part on the nature of the Court’s ruling as to the scope of
the Novell Judgment) for the parties to supplement the existing briefing, and the Court may want
to hear additional argument. Not only does the Novell Judgment affect these claims in important
respects, but also the pending motions were made nearly five years ago and the body of relevant
case law has grown.
6.

Even if the Court were to grant IBM’s proposed summary judgment

motion (as to the impact of the Novell Judgment) in its entirety, we believe it will make sense for
the parties to submit a proposed scheduling order based upon that decision. While the Novell
Judgment had a significant impact on the claims and counterclaims in this case, it did not resolve
all of IBM’s counterclaims. For example, while the Novell Judgment strengthens IBM’s
counterclaims concerning SCO’s campaign to create fear, uncertainty and doubt about IBM’s
products and services, it does not completely resolve all of those claims. Thus, the Court will
need to address certain of the pending motions, which may also require supplemental briefing
and argument.

7.

Depending on what remains in the case following the Court’s ruling

concerning the impact of the Novell Judgment, and the pending summary judgment motions, the
Court may also need to decide certain other motions/objections (see Ex. A ¶ 12) in the event
SCO elects to pursue them.
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, IBM respectfully submits that the Court should re-open
the case and proceed as outlined above.
DATED this 24th of May 2013.
