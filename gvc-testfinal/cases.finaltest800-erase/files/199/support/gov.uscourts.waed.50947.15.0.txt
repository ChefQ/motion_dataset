A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) addresses the court’s

particular case unless the contrary affirmatively appears." Stock West, Inc. v.

3

Confederated Tribes, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989). A plaintiff bears the burden

4

to establish that subject matter jurisdiction is proper. Prescott v. United States, 973

F.2d696, 701 (9th Cir. 1992).
A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) states that the facts, as pled,

fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FRCP 12(b)(6). In ruling on such

a motion, legal conclusions cast as factual allegations may not benefit from the

presumption of truthfulness. In re Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc., 311 F.3d 198, 216

Plaintiff’s Claims and Background Facts.

and AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc. (a collection agency), but reached a

18
19
20

settlement with Credit One and has dismissed that Defendant. (Dkt.# 10). The facts and
claims alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint are sparse, but sufficient for this Court to

21

determine the issues in this Motion as a matter of law. Specifically, Plaintiff states that

22

he:

23
24
25
26

(1) filed for Bankruptcy protection on February 16, 2010;
(2) notified Credit One of his bankruptcy and retention of counsel; and
(3) on May 21, 2010, AllianceOne attempted to collect a debt previously
assigned by Credit One.

(Dkt. #1 at pg. 3.)
He concludes, based on the above facts, that AllianceOne violated 15 U.S.C.
§1692f(1), by attempting to collect a debt which it could not legally collect, and
§1692c(a)(2), by communicating with Harvey after he had sent written notification that

5

he was represented by counsel. He also alleges state law claims. (Dkt. #1 at pg. 3.)

§1692f(1) Claim and Analysis of Walls v. Wells Fargo

9

12

In 1997, Donna Marie Walls filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and listed,
among other debts, a $118,000 obligation to Wells Fargo Bank. Walls v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 276 F.3d 502 (9th Cir. 2002). Ms. Walls received a discharge in January,

13
14
15

1998. Walls at 503. Ms. Walls subsequently filed suit against Wells Fargo Bank in
federal district court, alleging that the Bank had attempted to collect on the debt during

16

the automatic stay as well as after she received her discharge, in violation of 11 U.S.C.

17

sec. 524, and further alleged that such conduct violated the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. sec.

18

1692f. Id.

19

Wells Fargo moved to dismiss the FDCPA claim under FRCP 12(b)(6) for lack of

20
21
22

jurisdiction and the district court granted the motion. Id.
On appeal, Walls argued to the Ninth Circuit that an FDCPA claim is "outside of

23

the bankruptcy proceedings because the bankruptcy is over and done with, while the

24

FDCPA is needed to protect a debtor who has been discharged." Id.

25
26

In considering her argument, the Ninth Circuit focused on the basis for Walls

Case 2:10-cv-05091-RMP

1

FDCPA claim under §1692f , which clearly arose out of an alleged violation of 11

2

U.S.C. § 524, and found that such necessarily entailed "bankruptcy-laden

3

determinations." Walls at 515.

4
5

The Court further explained:

6

The Bankruptcy Code provides its own remedy for violating §524,
civil contempt under §105. To permit a simultaneous claim under
the FDCPA would allow through the back door what Walls cannot
accomplish through the front door -- a private right of action. This
would circumvent the remedial scheme of the Code under which
Congress struck a balance between the interests of debtors and creditors
by permitting (and limiting) debtors’ remedies for violating the discharge
injunction to contempt. . . . Nothing in either Act persuades us that
Congress intended to allow debtors to bypass the Code’s remedial
scheme when it enacted the FDCPA..

7

Walls at 515-16.

15
16

In reaching its conclusion to affirm the District Court’s dismissal, the Ninth

17

Circuit added: "because Walls remedy for violation of §524, no matter how cast, lies in

18

the Bankruptcy Code, her simultaneously FDCPA claim is precluded". Id. at 516-17

19

(emphasis added).

20
21

Just as in Walls, here Mr. Harvey is precluded from bringing a private right of
action in District Court for an FDCPA violation under §1692f, where his claim is, at its

22
23
24

essence, a claim for violation of §524 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Plaintiff’s §1692f claim against AllianceOne should be dismissed.

§1692c(a)(2) Claim, Notice of Representation

CASE NO. CV-10-5091-RMP

Case 2:10-cv-05091-RMP

Document 15

Filed 04/06/11

1

With regard to the claim that AllianceOne violated §1692c(a)(2), the Complaint

2

clearly states that notice was sent to Credit One, not AllianceOne, its agent. (Dkt.# 1).

3
4

In the context of FDCPA issues, notice to a principal (here, Credit One) does not operate
as notice an agent. Clark v. Capital Credit, 460 F.3d 1162, 1177 (9th Cir. 2006). Thus,

5
6

Plaintiff fails to state a claim against AllianceOne under §1692c(a)(2) because he does

7

not allege any notice to AllianceOne of representation by counsel. This claim should be

8

dismissed.

D.

State law claims, Declining Jurisdiction

If the above-discussed federal claims are dismissed, this Court should decline
jurisdiction over the state law claims. The Ninth Circuit has specifically stated that a trial

13
14
15

court should dismiss pendent state claims when no federal claims remain. Jones v.
Community Redevelopment Agency, 733 F.2d 646, 651 (9th Cir. 1984).

Dated this 6th day of April, 2011.
