NO. CV-10-5091-RMP
PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff-John C. Harvey (Harvey) is seeking relief for wrongful actions that

29

Defendant-AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc. (AllianceOne) undertook

30

during Harvey’s bankruptcy. These collection attempts were made during the

31

automatic stay and therefore could not be legally carried out. As AllianceOne was

32

attempting to collect on a debt which they could not legally collect, Harvey filed

33

suit under the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq.

2

seq. (the WSCAA) as statutes which can govern the behavior at issue.

3

Alternatively, Ninth Circuit case law suggests that if a cause of action is

4

erroneously filed in District Court which should have been filed in Bankruptcy

5

Court the proper course of action is for the District Court to transfer the case over

6

to the Bankruptcy Court rather than dismiss the claim. As such, dismissal in this

instance in inappropriate under the theories presented by the Defendants.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITES

8
9
10

A.

Legal Standard Applicable to Defendants’ 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss.
Ninth Circuit case law holds that a court should not dismiss a complaint

11

under rule 12(b)(6) unless there is no set of facts, if proven, which would support

12

the cause of action alleged by the plaintiff under any “cognizable legal theory.”

13

Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).

14

Here, the Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts which, if true, would entitle

15

them to recovery under a legitimate legal theory. Namely, the Plaintiff alleges that

16

AllianceOne attempted to collect a debt which it could not legally collect.

17

Complaint at 4.2, Harvey v. AllianceOne Receivables Management Inc. et al., No.

18

CV-10-5091-RMP, (E.D.Wash. 2010). This allegation, if proven, is a violation of

19

the FDCPA and the WSCAA and would entitle Harvey to recovery under both

20

Acts. See 15 U.S.C. 1962f(1) and RCW 19.16.250(18).

1

The facts pleaded to support Harvey’s allegation is that prior to February 16,

2

2010 Harvey entered into a credit card arrangement with Credit One. On February

3

16, 2010 Harvey filed for bankruptcy protection and notified Credit One of his

4

bankruptcy and that he had retained Robert J. Reynolds as his attorney. See

5

Exhibit “A”. The notice stated that, "the filing of the bankruptcy case stays certain

6

collections and other actions against the debtor and the debtor's property. If you

7

attempt to collect a debt or take other action in violation of the Bankruptcy Code,

8

you may be penalized." Id. Prior to May 21, 2010 Credit One retained

9

AllianceOne as its collection agent for the purposes of collecting a debt from

10

Harvey. On May 21, 2010 AllianceOne attempted to collect on this debt. See

11

Exhibit “B”. On June 3, 2010, Harvey was granted a discharge by the bankruptcy

12

court. See Exhibit “C”. Thus, Defendants’ behavior would constitute a violation

13

of 11 USC 362 and an attempt to collect on a debt when it could not legally do so.

14

However, the Defendant does not attack the factual basis of the complaint in

15

“AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc.’s Memorandum of Points and

16

Authorities in Support of its Motion to Dismiss” (Defendant’s Brief) but rather

17

claims that there is no cognizable legal theory under which they might be liable to

18

Harvey. In support of this contention they claim that the Bankruptcy Code

19

preempts Harvey’s claims, although this issue is not a point of settled law.

Bankruptcy Code Does Not Apply To Violations Of The Automatic Stay.

Ninth Circuit Case Law Concerning The Exclusivity Of The

The Defendant relies primarily on one case to support it contention that the

5
6

Bankruptcy Code preempts the FDCPA and WSCAA in this case, Walls v. Wells

7

Fargo Bank, N.A., 276 F.3d 502 (9th Cir. 2002). In this case the debtor alleged

8

that the creditor violated 11 USC 524(a) giving rise to a private cause of action.

9

Walls at 504. The debtor argued that the appropriate private cause of action was

10

one under the FDCPA. Id. The court held that a violation of 11 USC 524(a) does

11

not give rise to a private cause of action and therefore cannot support an FDCPA

12

claim.

However, Defendant fails to disclose the reasoning that the Walls court used
to reach its conclusion. The Walls court stated:
Congress certainly knows how to create a private right of action when it
wants to; for sure it knew how to create a private right of action when it
amended §§ 362 and 524 in 1984. Both sections were enacted on
November 6, 1978, and neither explicitly provided for a private right of
action. Each had generally been held enforceable only through an action for
contempt. In the 1984 amendments, Congress added subsection (h) to §
362, expressly conferring on debtors the right to sue for damages for a
willful violation of the automatic stay. Section 524 was amended on the
same day, but no similar provision, providing a private right of action for
violation of the discharge injunction, was added. Had Congress meant to
create a private right of action for violations of § 524, it could easily have
done so; that it did not is a strong indiction (sic) that it did not intend any

such remedy. … Moreover, creation of an express right of action under the
automatic stay provision responded to widespread criticism of the need to
rely on the contempt power to remedy violations of § 362.

Walls at 508-509. Thus, Walls actually is the basis of Harvey’s claim rather than

5

the case which precludes it.

Violations of 11 USC 362.

9

The FDCPA And WSCAA Are Appropriate Statutes To Remedy The

11 USC 362(k) provides, “an individual injured by any willful violation of a

10

stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and

11

attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.”

12

These damages are the exact same as those provided in the FDCPA and WSCAA

13

except the punitive damages in a FDCPA claim are capped at $1,000. Thus the

14

FDCPA provides for a remedy of the type and kind envisioned in 11 USC 362(k).

15

Additionally, the FDCPA’s explicit purpose matches the purpose expressed

16

in 11 USC 362. Congress included the automatic stay in bankruptcy proceedings

17

to give the debtors a breathing spell and relief from the harassment of debt

18

collectors. Pertuso v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 233 F.3d 417, 421 (6th Cir. 2000).

19

Similarly, the FDCPA was enacted to prevent or discourage debt collectors from

20

harassing debtors. Congress believed that such harassment caused unacceptable

21

strains on individual’s marriages, job performance and personal quietude.

Since the purpose of the two provisions is the same and the remedies

outlined in each are identical, it is clear that the FDCPA is a suitable vehicle for

3

enforcing 11 USC 362.

To Bankruptcy Court.

7

If This Court Declines To Hear This Claim, It Should Refer The Claim

Even if this Court should hold that Harvey’s claim is pre-empted by the

8

Bankruptcy Code and can only be remedied through the bankruptcy courts, the

9

appropriate remedy is to refer the case to the bankruptcy court and allow it to

10

fashion an appropriate remedy under its powers under 11 USC 105(a). Walls at

11

507. Thus a dismissal of this claim with prejudice would be inappropriate and any

12

dismissal would only be appropriate if there was a concurrent referral of the case to

13

the bankruptcy court.

14

CONCLUSION

15
16

Plaintiffs allege that Defendant violated the FDCPA and WSCAA while

17

collecting a debt which was subject to an automatic stay in bankruptcy pursuant to

18

11 USC 362. Since 11 USC 362(k) provides a private cause of action, the FDCPA

19

and WSCAA are appropriate statutory vehicles for enforcing the automatic stay.
