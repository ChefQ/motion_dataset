DEFENDANT GARY M. KORNMAN’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO WITHDRAW BANKRUPTCY REFERENCE, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT

Defendant Gary M. Kornman files this response to Plaintiff Carl E. Berg’s Motion to
Withdraw Bankruptcy Reference, and Brief in Support, as follows:
I.
INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In June 2006, the United States Trustee presiding over the bankruptcy of The Heritage
Organization, L.L.C. (“Heritage”) filed an adversary complaint against Defendant Berg, seeking
to recover on a promissory note payable to Heritage in the original principal amount of
$3,009,362. On August 11, 2006, Berg answered in this proceeding, asserting allegations and
claims arising out of a written agreement between Heritage and Berg, and related to tax strategies
provided to Berg pursuant to that Agreement.
Berg’s allegations and claims against Heritage are substantially similar to those being
raised and considered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with claims of other former
Heritage clients. Like those claims, Berg’s claims are governed by the written agreement
between Berg and Heritage. Kornman and the Trustee believes that such written agreement is

dispositive of claims raised by former Heritage clients, and that such claims should be resolved
in the Bankruptcy Court by way of summary judgment.
Berg’s responsive pleading also asserts numerous third-party claims against Kornman. In
this regard, however, Berg asserts the exact same causes of action and damages against Kornman
that are asserted in response to the Trustee’s claim against Berg. In fact, Berg’s third-party
allegations against Kornman are almost identical to his pleadings in response to the Trustee’s
claims. Kornman contends that Berg’s written agreement with Heritage also bars any claims
asserted individually against Kornman, and that the Bankruptcy Court’s consideration of
summary judgment motions with respect to the Heritage agreement will essentially dispose of
such claims.
In September 2006, Berg filed a proof of claim in the Heritage bankruptcy, in the amount
of $9,270,318. The sole basis for Berg’s proof of claim was the allegations set forth in his
responsive pleading and the damages alleged therein against Heritage. The Trustee’s objection
to this proof of claim is due on November 30, 2006.
After placing his proof of claim, responsive adversary pleading and third-party adversary
claims squarely before the Bankruptcy Court and invoking its jurisdiction, and after choosing the
forum for his claims against Kornman, Berg now reverses course and asks that all these matters
be withdrawn from the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdiction.
II.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
As set forth in Berg’s Motion to Withdraw, there are essentially four (4) matters that are
to be adjudicated in any proceeding involving Berg, Heritage and Kornman:
(i)

the Trustee’s Bankruptcy Court adversary complaint against Berg;

MOTION TO WITHDRAW BANKRUPTCY REFERENCE, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT

Page 3 of 11 PageID 120

(ii)

Berg’s $9 million proof of claim in the Heritage bankruptcy proceeding and the
claims alleged by Berg in response to the Trustee’s complaint, as well as any
objection by the Trustee to same;

(iii)

Berg’s third-party claims against Kornman, premised entirely on the same facts
that underlie the dispute between Berg and Heritage; and

(iv)

Kornman’s claim for indemnification against Heritage’s bankruptcy estate, since
Berg seeks damages from Kornman related to Heritage matters.

As can readily be seen, three of these four issues are substantial bankruptcy matters that
directly and centrally involve the administration of Heritage’s estate. The fourth matter, the
third-party claims against Kornman, are entirely derivative of Berg’s identical bankruptcy claims
against Heritage and were voluntarily placed by Berg within the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding this, and irrespective of the fact that the Bankruptcy Court is already
handling and considering substantially similar issues involving other former Heritage clients and
the written Heritage agreement, Berg now seeks to create a second and duplicative set of
proceedings in District Court in order to litigate these issues by way of a separate trial. Berg’s
request violates principles of judicial economy and well-settled law regarding the limited
circumstances for permissive withdrawal of the bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction, and should
therefore be denied.
A.

The Holland America Factors Support The Bankruptcy Court’s Retention Of Jurisdiction
Over These Matters.
A withdrawal of reference is intended to apply only to a limited class of proceedings, and

is not intended to be an “escape hatch” through which bankruptcy matters can be removed to
district court. In re Lifemark, 161 B.R. 21, 24 (E.D. La. 1993). Berg, as the moving party, bears
the burden of demonstrating sufficient “cause” for permissive withdrawal of the reference. See,
e.g., In re H&W Motor Express Co., 343 B.R.208, 213 (N.D. Iowa 2006).

In Holland America Insurance Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 998 (5th Cir.
1985), the Fifth Circuit set forth several factors to be considered in determining a withdrawal of
reference. None of these factors support Berg’s motion or the withdrawal of the reference for any
matters and proceedings involving Heritage, Berg and Kornman.
1.

Whether the proceedings are “core” or “non-core”

Berg’s brief concedes that three of the four matters that are the subject of his motion – the
trustee’s adversary complaint, Berg’s proof of claim and the trustee’s objections thereto, and
Kornman’s indemnification claim – are “core” matters.

As such, regardless of any

characterization of the third-party claim against Kornman, it is clear that the predominant nature
of the parties’ respective issues are “core”. 1
The fourth matter to be adjudicated in this dispute – the third-party claims against
Kornman – is not comprised of independent claims based on any facts outside the Heritage
bankruptcy. Instead, all claims against Kornman are premised entirely upon the very same facts
alleged against Heritage, and are alleged against Kornman solely because of actions allegedly
taken as a representative of Heritage. As such, the Bankruptcy Court’s consideration of these
issues on behalf of the bankruptcy estate will necessarily involve consideration of issues relating
to Kornman.
Moreover, the claims against Kornman cannot be viewed in isolation, but rather must be
considered in light of their practical effect – the indemnification claim being asserted in turn by
Kornman against Heritage’s bankruptcy estate.

Because all issues and claims in this case

1

Even if the third-party claims against Kornman are non-core, that factor does not require withdrawal of the
reference. In re H&W Motor Express Co., 343 B.R. 208, 216 (N.D. Iowa 2006). Otherwise, such reasoning would
prevent any non-core matter from ever being referred to the bankruptcy court. In re Ames Dept. Stores, Inc., 190
B.R. 157, 163 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).

ultimately have a direct effect on the Heritage bankruptcy, they should be considered in unison
by the Bankruptcy Court.
2.

Promotion of uniformity in bankruptcy administration

Berg argues that this factor weighs in favor of withdrawal, so that all issues can be settled
in one proceeding. Kornman agrees that all these issues should be resolved in one proceeding –
in Heritage’s bankruptcy, where those issues are already pending and being actively considered
by the Bankruptcy Court.
“If a bankruptcy court is already familiar with the facts of the underlying action, then
allowing that court to adjudicate the proceeding will promote uniformity in the bankruptcy
administration.” In re Doctor’s Hosp. 1997, L.P., 2006 WL 2847896 at *42 (S.D. Tex.); In re
Hargis, 146 B.R. 173, 176 (N.D. Tex. 1992). The Bankruptcy Court has been administering this
proceeding since 2004, and continues to preside over and consider issues relating to (i) the
Trustee’s adversary lawsuits against former Heritage clients who executed promissory notes
payable to Heritage, (ii) those former clients’ proofs of claim against Heritage, (iii) the Trustee’s
objections to those claims, and (iv) the written agreement between Heritage and its former
clients, which specifically governs the relationship between those parties and the former clients’
claims.

Importantly, this written agreement also specifically contains releases of Heritage

representatives such as Kornman, as well as other provisions that are arguably dispositive of
Berg’s claims against Kornman.
Uniformity in the administration of the Heritage bankruptcy estate can only be achieved
through adjudication of these common issues in a single forum. Because these issues must be
resolved by the Bankruptcy Court irrespective of Berg’s claims, this factor clearly weighs against
withdrawal of the reference.

Forum shopping and confusion

Curiously, Berg argues that “the current proceeding has the effect as [sic] forum
shopping”, even though it is Berg who chose to assert his third-party claims against Kornman in
the Bankruptcy Court. Kornman respectfully submits that Berg misunderstands the nature of this
particular Holland America factor.
Neither the Trustee nor Kornman have “shopped” for alternative forums for any claims
related to this dispute. Rather, it is Berg who voluntarily asserted the claims against Kornman in
Bankruptcy Court and has now apparently decided with little explanation that he prefers to
litigate these claims, together with several matters substantially affecting the Heritage
bankruptcy estate, in federal district court. Regardless of Berg’s motivations for such action, he
clearly cannot argue in good faith that this Holland America factor can conceivably weigh in his
favor.
Moreover, this Holland America factor also incorporates the notion of “confusion.”
Kornman submits that the litigation of similar and related issues in two different forums with two
different judges will not simplify or clarify any of the issues that are currently being actively
litigated in Bankruptcy Court.
4.

Economical use of debtor and creditor resources

For the same reasons, the policy of encouraging economical use of the debtor’s and
creditor’s resources similarly weighs against withdrawal of the reference. “When a bankruptcy
court is intimately familiar with the facts, parties and issues, a withdrawal of reference would
only further delay final resolution of the suit.” In re Doctor’s Hosp., 2006 WL 2847896 at *44;
In re Hargis, 146 B.R. at 176.

Moreover, circumstances dictate against withdrawal of a

reference when a district court would have to spend substantial time to become familiar with the

MOTION TO WITHDRAW BANKRUPTCY REFERENCE, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT
01654-605/15723

parties and issues, particularly when those efforts would be duplicative of work that the
Bankruptcy Court has already performed. In re Doctor’s Hosp., 2006 WL 2847896 at *44.
As mentioned above, the Bankruptcy Court is already considering similar issues
concerning adversary proceedings based on promissory notes payable to Heritage, proofs of
claim filed by former Heritage clients, and arguments about Heritage and its representatives that
are identical to those alleged by Berg. More importantly, the Bankruptcy Court will continue to
consider and adjudicate these issues regardless of where Berg’s claims proceed. As such,
Heritage will have to incur significant time and expense litigating these matters in two forums in
the event Berg’s claims proceed in District Court. Berg, on the other hand, will be required to
incur the same amount of time and expense regardless of where these issues are litigated.
Finally, since the issues central to Berg’s matters are also comprised within other matters
being considered by the Bankruptcy Court, it will be less burdensome and time-consuming for
that court to resolve those issues than it would for the District Court to take this matter up anew
from its inception. As such, considerations of the debtor’s and creditor’s resources, in addition
to notions of judicial economy, support denial of Berg’s motion to withdraw.
5.

Expediting the bankruptcy process

“A bankruptcy court which has conducted hearings in a case for an extensive period of
time is in the best position to expedite the bankruptcy process.” In re Doctor’s Hosp., 2006 WL
2847896 at *44. As set forth above, the Bankruptcy Court is familiar with all these issues, and
can resolve them as it resolves other similar matters. This Holland America factor similarly does
not support Berg’s motion.

Existence of jury demand

Berg concedes there is no jury demand in this case, and that the relevant documents
contain a waiver of jury trial. As such, this factor also dictates against withdrawal of the
reference.
B.

Berg’s Jurisdictional Argument Does Not Justify Withdrawal Of The Reference.
As Berg points out, Kornman has stipulated in writing that the Bankruptcy Court has

jurisdiction over the third-party claims asserted by Berg against Kornman. In his third-party
pleadings against Kornman, Berg also has affirmatively represented that the Bankruptcy Court
has jurisdiction over Kornman for purposes of such claims. See Berg’s Third-Party Petition at ¶
63. Notwithstanding this, Berg continues to argue that the parties hypothetically might not be
“correct” in their jurisdictional stipulations in this regard, and that identical proceedings should
therefore be created and adjudicated in the District Court.

Berg cites two cases for this

jurisdictional argument.
In re Walker, 51 F.3d 562 (5th Cir. 1995) states that the Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction
over all matters that “relate to” a bankruptcy proceeding. A matter is “related” for jurisdictional
purposes if “the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate
being administered in bankruptcy” – in other words, “if the outcome could alter the debtor’s
rights, liabilities, options or freedom of action (positively or negatively) and which in any way
impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.” Id. at 569.
In Walker, the creditor’s third-party contribution claim merely sought to determine
whether another party was responsible to reimburse a creditor for damages paid to the bankrupt
party, and therefore had no effect on the bankruptcy estate. This is easily distinguished from the
instant case, where Berg’s claims against Kornman are the source of an indemnity claim asserted

MOTION TO WITHDRAW BANKRUPTCY REFERENCE, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT
01654-605/15723

Page 8

Case 3:06-cv-02030-N Document 8 Filed 11/22/06

directly against the Heritage bankruptcy estate. As clearly stated by Berg himself in his own
brief, Berg’s claims against Kornman are “related to” the Heritage estate “because if Berg
prevails, Kornman will seek indemnification from the debtor.” See Berg’s Motion at p. 6.
Berg also relies upon In re Canion, 196 F.3d 579 (5th Cir. 1999), in which a judgment
creditor filed suit against friends, relatives and business associates of the bankrupt debtor,
alleging interference with the creditor’s attempt to collect its judgment from the debtor. Berg
fails to point out that the Canion case involved separate findings by the district court, bankruptcy
court and the appellate court that such claims, which were more tenuously “related” to the
subject bankruptcy than Berg’s claims against Kornman, were in fact within the bankruptcy
court’s jurisdiction. Id. at 581-87.
As stated in Canion, the appropriate test for “related to” jurisdiction is not whether the
claim ultimately has an actual effect on the estate, but whether at the time of the referral such
claim might have any “conceivable” potential future effect. Id. at 586-87. Kornman’s claim
against Heritage for indemnification from Berg’s third-party claims conceivably affects the
estate and its current administration, and Berg’s claims are therefore “related to” the Heritage
bankruptcy.
Berg has cited no case law supporting his jurisdictional argument. The Bankruptcy Court
has “related to” jurisdiction over Berg’s third-party claims against Kornman, and the Bankruptcy
Court should adjudicate those claims in the course of its ongoing administration of Heritage’s
bankruptcy.
III.
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Kornman requests that Plaintiff
Berg’s motion be in all things denied, that the matters set forth in Plaintiff Berg’s motion

not be withdrawn, and for all such other and further relief to which Defendant Kornman might be
