OPPOSITION TO MOTION REQUESTING
SERVICE OF PROCESS [DKT # 54]

JESSE ANNE MAJORS,
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No.: 2:11cv00558 CW

THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW,
et al,
Defendants.

DEFENDANT HAS NOT FOLLOWED THE RULE
Rule 4(b) Fed. R. Civ. P. is straight forward and requires that a party seeking to serve a
summons and complaint on another party prepare a summons in the proper form and have the
summons issued by the clerk. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s multiple applications to the court to
ignore the provisions of Rule 4 Defendant’s counsel does not recall seeing a single proper form
federal summons prepared by the Plaintiff and submitted for service under Rule 4. (The summons

served on Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law was a state court summons which Plaintiff
could sign herself under Rule 4 Utah R. Civ. P.) The clerk’s notice of lodging strongly suggests that
the summons Plaintiff has submitted are not in proper form and were not properly issued. If the
Plaintiff had spent as much time and money actually following Rule 4 as she has spent trying to
circumvent it it is likely that she would have been able to serve the individuals.
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT HIDING
The individuals Plaintiff has listed as Defendants are all either administrators, faculty, or
otherwise affiliated with the Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law, a California corporation.
Though they may not be clamoring to receive Plaintiff’s summons and complaint neither are they
hiding from her, or her process server, nor otherwise attempting to avoid service. If Plaintiff’s
process server appeared at the Law School on virtually any day school is in session the odds are
good that most or all of the listed individuals would be there. Certainly if Plaintiff had some factual
basis for claiming these individuals are avoiding service the court could consider a proper motion for
substituted service. However, such a motion would require that Plaintiff provide something other
than speculation to show that one, or some, or all of them are properly subject to substituted service.
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT LIABLE
Typically Defendant’s counsel would accept service for proper individual Defendants in a
case with colorable claims. However, at this juncture there is nothing to suggest there are any
colorable claims against any individual Plaintiff has included in the body of her complaint or in the
caption of the case. As noted, Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law is a California
corporation in good standing and there is no reason to believe that the corporate veil does not protect

the individuals in that they were all acting within the scope of their employment in their dealings
with Plaintiff.
THE CLASS IS FUZZY
Plaintiff’s motion is further problematic in that it is difficult to know who she believes it is
that ought to be deemed served. She has included a matrix with her various filings showing to whom
it is she has sent documents which she believes should substitute for actual service. However, she
has also listed in her caption “all members of the ethics committee of the Thomas Jefferson School
of Law.” Presumably she believes that this description, in conjunction with her motion to ignore
service under Rule 4, is sufficient to allow the unnamed members of this group to become
Defendants and to be required to file an answer.
THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO WAIT
Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law believes that the proper approach for the court to
take in response to this motion is to defer a ruling until issues associated with the pending motion to
dismiss have been resolved. If Plaintiff is able to draft a complaint which actually states a cause of
action under the Twombly/Iqbal standards then we can look at who it is that ought to be listed as a
proper individual Defendant. At that time Plaintiff will very likely not be looking at trying to serve
all 16 individuals listed in her caption, in addition to the members of the ethics committee. If any
individuals remain as Defendants Plaintiff’s difficulty in getting actual personal service will likely
be significantly reduced.
CONCLUSION
The Defendant has not attempted to comply with Rule 4 and is not in a position to seek

alternative service. The fact that she is apparently incapable of following the rule does not mean the
court must relieve her of that burden. This motion should be tabled until, or if, a proper group of
individual Defendants is identified.
