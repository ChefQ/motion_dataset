BACKGROUND

Plaintiff has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Plaintiff has already

expended over $175.00 in attempting service of process on all defendants listed in the Amended

 

Proof of Service of Affidavit and Summons

Approved Board of Justice Court Judges September 22, 2010 Page 1 of 4

Complaint. Plaintiff is also unaware if she still has the assistance of counsel. Therefore,
Plaintiff is requesting service of process costs be waived or that the court allocates an alternate
way to serve said Defendants a copy of the summons and complaint without incurring further

costs.
MOTION FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS

Defense counsel has stated (Docket #52) that Plaintiff has exceeded the time limit for
serving the Defendants, Plaintiff directs the court to Plaintiffs motions (Dockets #19 and #51)
that Plaintiff has made multiple attempts to serve Defendants and that she has met her burden of

reasonable diligence in getting said Defendants served.

Furthermore, Plaintiff was awarded assistance of counsel on August 15, 2011. The
complaint was removed to federal court on June 16, 2011. The time limit has not expired
according to these dates. If the time limit has passed, it is because Plaintiffs counsel, Shane
Shumway, did not prepare the Summons for Service of Process as directed by Plaintiff. Nor did
counsel, Shane Shumway, file an Alternate Service of Process Request as directed by Plaintiff.
Thus, it is not Plaintiff's error that time has passed, which Plaintiff argues has not. Nor is it
Plaintiffs error that Defendants have not been served by an alternate method. She should,

therefore, be allowed to continue the service of process procedure.

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the clerk of court or Plaintiff be allowed to prepare
new summons to get all Defendants properly served in accordance with Utah Rule of Civil

Procedure 4,

DATED this 5TH day of October, 2011.
