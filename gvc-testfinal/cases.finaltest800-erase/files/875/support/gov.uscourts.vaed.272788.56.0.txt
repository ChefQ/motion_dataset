Motion fp Disvrres
Notre of heaving 20vh Ayah at (07

I, Linda Howard request the court to dismiss case 1:11 CV1105 for the following
reason:

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule (19) failure to join the party.

My husband Russell Howard is not in the United States and has not been in the
United States since June 2010.

The court has no jurisdiction over my husband since he is not a citizen of the
United States and the alleged incidents claimed by the plaintiff did not occur in the
United States. The alleged incidents did not occur between citizens of the United
States,

Since Russell Howard is required to be joined and cannot be joined, Russell
Howard is indispensible to the action. The court must determine whether, in equity
and good conscience, the action should proceed.
