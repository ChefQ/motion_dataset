Whether This Case Should Be Deemed
KRAFT FOODS GLOBAL, INC., Related to Case No. 3:08-cv-00930-JCS
Defendant.

 

 

TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF
CALIFORNA, AND TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, pursuant to Rules 3-12 and 7-11 of the Civil Local Rules
for the Northern District of California, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. ("KFG") hereby submits this
Administrative Motion seeking an order that the above-captioned action is related to an action that
is pending in this district following transfer from the Western District of Wisconsin, entitled Kraft
Foods Holdings, Inc. and Kraft Foods Global, Inc. v. The Procter & Gamble Company, Case No.
3:08-cv-00930 (the "transferred action"). (See Transfer Order, Declaration of Evette D.
Pennypacker ("Pennypacker Decl."), Ex. A)

The Wisconsin action was transferred to this Court because it is virtually identical in every

way to the above-captioned action. See id. at 5. The two cases more than qualify as "related"

pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-12 because they involve the same parties, assert virtually identical
claims, and involve the same property, transactions, events and questions of law. Civ. L.R. 3-
12(a)(1). It appears likely that there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and
expense, or conflicting results, if the cases are conducted before different judges. Civ. L.R. 3-
12(a)(2). Kraft therefore requests that the Court find the transferred action related to the above-

captioned action.

Memorandum of Points and Authorities
Statement of Facts

The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G") filed the above-captioned action against Kraft
Foods Group, Inc. (""KFG") on August 27, 2007, alleging that KFG's sales of Maxwell House(R)
brand coffee sold in 39-ounce plastic containers infringed U.S. Patent No. 7,169,418 ("*418
patent"). (Pennypacker Decl., Exs. B, C) The `418 patent currently is subject to an inter partes
reexamination proceeding. On October 11, 2007, this Court stayed the litigation pending the
completion of the `418 patent reexamination.

On October 26, 2007, Kraft Foods Holdings, Inc. (""KFH") sued P&G in the Western
District of Wisconsin, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,074,443 (`443 patent). P&G
used KFH's infringement action as its excuse to file a duplicative counterclaim and third party
complaint against KFH and KFG (collectively, "Kraft"), alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,169,419 (419 patent"). (Id., Exs. D, E) P&G's `419 counterclaim, like its stayed `418 claim,
alleged infringement based on Kraft's sales of the same Maxwell House brand coffee sold in the
same 39-ounce plastic containers.

On November 29, 2007, Kraft filed in the Western District of Wisconsin a motion to
dismiss P&G's counterclaim and third party complaint, or in the alternative, to stay the claims or
transfer them to this District for consideration with P&G's `418 claims. After the motion was
fully briefed, the Western District of Wisconsin ordered P&G's counterclaim and third party
complaint severed and transferred to this District. (Id., Ex. A) The court found that "[t]he facts
and circumstances surrounding P&G's counterclaim and third party claim for infringement of the
`419 patent weigh heavily in favor of transfer to conserve judicial resources," in part because
"discovery concerning the `418 and `419 patents will be intertwined" (id. at 9) and also because of
the "risk of inconsistent claim construction and inconsistent judgments." (Id. at 10)

On February 13, 2008, pursuant to the transfer order, P&G's counterclaims were docketed
in this District as case number 3:08-cv-00930-JCS (the "transferred action"). _

Kraft has met and conferred with P&G and confirmed that P&G opposes this motion for

administrative relief. (Pennypacker Decl. at J9)

Case 3:07-cv-04413-PJH Document 74 Filed 02/14/2008 Page 4 of 7

Argument

I. The Transferred Action And The Current Action Concern Substantially The
Same Parties, Property, Transactions or Events.

The transferred action (Pennypacker Decl., Ex. D) is related to the above-captioned action
(Pennypacker Decl., Ex. B) because the two actions concern substantially the same parties,
property, transaction or events. Civ. L-R. 3-12(a)(1). Both actions were brought by P&G against
KFG. The transferred action also names KFH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFG, but this is the
only difference between the parties in the two actions. (Compare Pennypacker Decl., Ex. B at 1
with Ex. D at 1)

Both actions also assert that the exact same Kraft product infringes nearly identical P&G
patents. In particular, in the above-captioned action, P&G alleges that KFG's sales of Maxwell
House(R) brand coffee in 39-ounce plastic containers infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,169,418 ("418
patent"). (Pennypacker Decl., Ex. C and Ex. B at 0x00A77) In the transferred action, P&G alleges that
KFG's and KFH's alleged sales of the same Maxwell House brand coffee in the same 39-ounce
plastic containers infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,169,419 ("`419 patent"). (Pennypacker Decl., Exs. E
and F) |

P&G's contentions for why Kraft's 39-ounce plastic containers infringe the `418 patent are
virtually identical to P&G's contentions for why the same containers infringe the `419 patent.
(Compare Pennypacker Decl. Ex. F with Ex. G at 8-13) Both actions seek to enjoin such sales and
to recover money damages for all infringing sales. (Compare Pennypacker Decl., Ex. B at 3 with
Ex. D at 8)

The `418 patent asserted in the above-captioned action is substantially similar to the `419
patent asserted in the transferred action. (Compare Pennypacker Decl., Ex. C with Ex. E) The
two patents, which were issued the same day and have the same name, are both directed to a
plastic package for roast and ground coffee, and the two patents share the same primary examiner,
the same prosecuting attorneys, and many of the same cited references. (Id.) The `419 patent is
also a continuation-in-part of the application that led to the `418 patent, and both patents claim to

relate back to provisional application No. 60/295,666. (Id.) Consequently, the specifications of (c)

8 Both actions accuse the exact same product of infririgement. (Compare Pennypacker

9 || Decl., Ex. B at 47 with Ex. F) Both actions involve virtually identical parties. (Compare

10 || Pennypacker Decl., Ex. B at 1 with Ex. D at 1) And, the patent at issue in the transferred action is
11 || virtually ident ical to the patent at issue in the above-captioned action, and shares the same primary
12 || examiner, the same prosecuting attorneys, and many of the same cited references. (Compare

13 || Pennypacker Decl., Ex. C with Ex. E) The discovery in the two cases will therefore be virtually
14 || identical. This fact lead the Western District of Wisconsin to find: "The facts and circumstances
15 || surrounding P&G's [transferred action] weigh heavily in favor of transfer to conserve judicial

16 || resources" in part because "discovery concerning the `418 and `419 patents will be intertwined."
17 (Pennypacker Decl., Ex. A at 9)

18 Moreover, because the many identical claim terms in the two patents must be construed the

19 || same, Abtox, Inc, v. Exitron Corp., 131 F.3d 1009, 1010 (Fed. Cir. 1997), conducting the two

 

 

20 || cases before different judges could very likely lead to conflicting claim constructions and

|
21 || therefore compuchne results. The Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that "the same term[s] and
22 || phrase[s] should be interpreted consistently where it appears in claims of common ancestry."

23 || Epcon Gas Sys., Inc. v. Bauer Compressors, Inc., 279 F.3d 1022, 1030 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also

 

 

24 || Elkway Mfg. Co. v. Ebco Mfg. Co., 192 F.3d 973, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Thus, as the Western
|

25 || District of Wisconsin noted: "[I]f P&G's [transferred claim] for infringement of the `419 patent is
26 || not transferr d and consolidated there remains a risk of inconsistent claim construction and

27 || inconsistent judgments." (Pennypacker Decl., Ex. A at 10)

Given the extensive overlap between the factual and legal issues to be decided in these two
actions, it is very likely that there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense
and conflicting results if the two cases are conducted before different judges. Civ. L.R. 3-12(a)(2).

Conclusion

The above-captioned action should be deemed related to the transferred action The Procter
& Gamble Company v. Kraft Foods Holdings, Inc. and Kraft Foods Global, Inc., Case No. 3:08-
cv-00930-JCS, because the two cases involve the same parties, assert substantially similar claims,
and involve the same property, transactions, events and questions of law. Civ. L.R. 3-12(a)(1).

It appears likely that there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense, or

conflicting results, if the cases are conducted before different judges. Civ. L.R. 3-12(a)(2).
