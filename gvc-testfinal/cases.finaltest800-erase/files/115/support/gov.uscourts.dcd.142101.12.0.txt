Civil Case No. 10-750 (JEB)

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
By memorandum opinion dated October 26, 2011, the Court held that Plaintiff, the
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (“Plaintiff” or “CREW”), was entitled to
attorney’s fees under the Freedom of Information Act’s (“FOIA”) fee provision. The entitlement
determination requires the Court to consider four non-exhaustive factors: (1) the public benefit
derived from the case; (2) the commercial benefit to the plaintiff; (3) the nature of the plaintiff’s
interest in the records; and (4) whether the government had a reasonable basis for withholding
the requested information. Notwithstanding that Plaintiff conceded that the records produced in
response to its March 3, 2010 FOIA request “shed[] no light on Mr. Yoo’s role in drafting the
torture memos or, indeed, on anything Mr. Yoo may have done while at DOJ,” the Court
apparently inferred a public benefit from the production’s absence of relevant information
because it “is precisely the kind of information CREW hoped to glean from its requests” as the
information “suggests that the missing emails concerning the torture memoranda were destroyed
willfully.” Mem. Op. at 11. That negative inference, however, was based on the incorrect and
unsupported factual premise that “the remaining emails had little to do with Yoo’s substantive

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 2 of 11

activities at OLC and . . . only mundane or unrelated email survived.” Mem. Op. at 11. In fact,
OLC withheld numerous substantive emails pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(5) because they are
privileged. The Department therefore respectfully requests that the Court reconsider its
determination.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
By letter dated February 26, 2010, CREW submitted a request to the Department of
Justice Office of Legal Counsel seeking
(a) Copies of record keeping guidance issued to staff of the Office of legal Counsel
(“OLC”) from January 2000 to the present concerning how electronic records, including
email, are to be treated for purposes of federal record keeping laws; and
(b) Records indicating, reflecting, or commenting on any problems with the storage or
retention of emails of OLC staff, including but not limited to former Assistant Attorneys
General John Yoo and Patrick Philbin, from January 2000 to July 2009.
See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for an Award of
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Pl. Mot.”) Ex. E (June 9, 2011) [ECF No. 7-1]. The letter
additionally requested expedited processing and a waiver of all processing fees. See Pl. Mot. Ex.
E.
Less than a week later, on March 3, 2010, Plaintiff submitted another FOIA request to
OLC. See Pl. Mot. Ex. I. This time, Plaintiff sought “a copy of all emails sent to or from former
Assistant Attorney General John Yoo from June 2001 through May 2003.” See Pl. Mot. Ex. I.
Although Plaintiff again sought a waiver of the fees associated with processing that request,
Plaintiff did not request that the processing be expedited. See Pl. Mot. Ex. I.
By letter dated March 16, 2010, OLC acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff’s February 26,
2010 request and advised that the Director of the Office of Public Affairs had granted Plaintiff’s
2

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 3 of 11

request for expedited processing. The letter further suggested, however, that “[i]n an effort to
speed up processing,” Plaintiff consider “narrow[ing] the scope of [its] request.” Pl. Mot. Ex. F.
Plaintiff availed itself of that option, and in a subsequent conversation with OLC’s Special
Counsel Paul Colborn agreed to a bifurcated processing of the February 26, 2010 request. The
processing of that request was completed before any involvement by the Court in this action,
which Plaintiff filed just weeks after reaching that agreement. See Complaint (May 11, 2010)
[ECF No. 1]. Thus, on August 2, 2010, the Court entered a paperless order adopting the
production schedule proposed by the Department for processing the March 3, 2010 request. OLC
complied with that schedule and subsequently produced a total of 229 records on August 31,
2010 and September 30, 2010 and a Vaughn Index on October 22, 2010. See Pl. Mot. Exs. J, K,
L.
OLC’s August 31, 2010 cover letter accompanying its production of records explained
that it was withholding approximately 147 records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(2), (b)(5),
and (b)(6). See Pl. Mot. Ex. J. OLC also provided CREW with an October 22, 2010 draft
Vaughn Index reflecting that the vast majority of the withheld documents were exempt under the
deliberative process privilege. Plaintiff did not challenge a single one of OLC’s withholdings.
After receiving the Vaughn Index, Plaintiff issued a press release admitting that the
documents released in response to the March 3, 2010 request “shed no light on what Mr. Yoo did
for the Department of Justice,” “shed[] no light on Mr. Yoo’s role in drafting the torture memos
or, indeed, on anything Mr. Yoo may have done while at the DOJ.” See “Found” John Yoo
Emails Shed No Light on What Mr. Yoo Did for the Department of Justice (Oct. 26, 2010),
published at www.citizensforethics.org/press/entry/found-john-yoo-emails-shed-no-light-on3

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 4 of 11

department-of-justice (hereinafter ““Found” Yoo Emails Shed No Light”). Notwithstanding that
admission, Plaintiff contended that the release of these records benefitted the public. That
contention, as the Department demonstrated, was belied by CREW’s own press release. The
Department also submitted a Declaration from OLC Special Counsel Paul Colborn that explained
“that most of the substantive emails that did shed light on what Mr. Yoo did at the Department
properly would have been withheld under Exemption Five, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).” Declaration of
Paul Colborn ¶ 23 (June 27, 2011) [ECF No. 8-2] (“Colborn Decl.”). Without addressing the
Colborn Declaration or OLC’s August 31, 2010 letter notifying CREW of the withholding of
privileged documents, the Court made the following factual finding:
The fact that the remaining emails had little to do with Yoo’s
substantive activities at OLC, therefore, is precisely the kind of
information CREW hoped to glean from its requests. That only
mundane or unrelated email survived, CREW maintains, suggests
that the missing emails concerning the torture memoranda were
destroyed willfully. In other words, that the “emails shed no light
on what Mr. Yoo did for the Department of Justice” itself sheds
light on the extent to which email[s] may have been purposefully
destroyed.
Mem. Op. at 11 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The Department respectfully submits that
this factual finding by the Court was clearly erroneous. Since that finding apparently was central
to the Court’s determination that Plaintiff was entitled to fees, the Department hereby moves for
reconsideration.1

ARGUMENT
A district court “may revise its own interlocutory decisions ‘at any time before the entry
of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.’”
Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. DHS, 2011 WL 4014308, at *3 (D.D.C., Sept. 12, 2011) (citation
omitted). The standard for providing relief upon such reconsideration is “as justice requires.”
Childers v. Slater, 197 F.R.D. 185, 190 (D.D.C. 2000) (citation omitted). “‘As justice requires’
indicates concrete considerations of whether the court ‘has patently misunderstood a party, has
made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the [c]ourt by the parties, has made an
error not of reasoning, but of apprehension, or where a controlling or significant change in the
law or facts [has occurred] since the submission of the issue to the court.’” Electronic Privacy
Info., 2011 WL 4014308, at *4. Such considerations “leave a great deal of room for the court’s
discretion and, accordingly, the ‘as justice requires’ standard amounts to determining ‘whether
[relief upon] reconsideration is necessary under the relevant circumstances.’” Id. Here, those
considerations warrant reconsideration of this Court’s conclusion that Plaintiff satisfied the
public-benefit factor of the entitlement test for fees under FOIA.
I.

THE COURT’S PUBLIC-BENEFIT DETERMINATION WAS BASED ON A
FACTUALLY ERRONEOUS NEGATIVE INFERENCE.
It is undisputed that the records produced in response to Plaintiff’s March 3, 2010 request

provided the public with no important information about the Department activities. See
“Found” Yoo Emails Shed No Light (admitting that the emails produced “shed[] no light on Mr.
Yoo’s role in drafting the torture memos or, indeed, on anything Mr. Yoo may have done while
at DOJ”). As this Court recognized, the mere “disclosure of government documents does not
satisfy the public interest factor.” Mem. Op. at 9 (quoting Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy,
5

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 6 of 11

Inc. v. Costle, 631 F. Supp. 1469, 1471 (D.D.C. 1986)). Nevertheless, the Court concluded that
the fact that the documents produced shed little if any light on government activities “itself sheds
light on the extent to which email may have been purposefully destroyed.” Mem. Op. at 11.
Specifically, the Court embraced Plaintiff’s assertion that “[t]he fact that the remaining emails
had little to do with Yoo’s substantive activities at OLC” “suggests that the missing emails
concerning the torture memoranda were destroyed willfully.” Mem. Op. at 11. In this context,
the Court also found it significant that “only mundane or unrelated email survived.” Mem. Op. at
11.
The Court’s factual inference, however, overlooks the uncontradicted statement in the
Declaration from OLC Special Counsel Paul Colborn that “[t]his result is unsurprising given that
most of the substantive emails that did shed light on what Mr. Yoo did at the Department
properly would have been withheld under Exemption Five, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).” Colborn Decl.
¶ 23. Mr. Yoo’s role at the Department was to provide confidential legal advice to assist in
Executive Branch decisionmaking. See Colborn Decl. ¶ 3. In this case, approximately 147
responsive and substantive emails were withheld by the Department pursuant to exemption (b)(5)
without objection from Plaintiff. See Pl Mot. Ex. J. For example, entries 35 and 36 on the draft
Vaughn Index provided to Plaintiff on October 22, 2010 are unclassified examples of the socalled “missing emails concerning the torture memoranda [that] were destroyed willfully,”
(Mem. Op. at 11). See Declaration of Jacqueline Coleman Snead ¶ 2 & att., attached hereto as
Exhibit B. Clearly, these documents were not missing but withheld pursuant to FOIA
exemption. See Colborn Decl. ¶ 13. Thus, the record did not support the Court’s negative
inference.

6

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 7 of 11

Additionally, because much of the work done by Mr. Yoo involved national security and
was classified, much of his work would not have been reflected in his emails. As established by
the attached Declaration of Sheryl Walter, Mr. Yoo did not have a classified email account
during the time he served at OLC. See Declaration of Sheryl L. Walter ¶¶ 4-5 (explaining that
“Yoo never had an account on OASIS” and “there was no other classified computer system with
an email capability” at Main Justice), attached hereto as Exhibit A. Thus, the absence of emails
related to much of Mr. Yoo’s work on the so-called “terror memoranda” is explained by their
classified subject-matter and not the Court’s negative inference of their willful destruction.
Moreover, as Plaintiff well knows, to the extent there were unclassified emails regarding “torture
memoranda,” they were withheld pursuant to exemption (b)(5) and not challenged by Plaintiff.
Indeed, tellingly, Plaintiff did not claim public benefit from the negative inference the Court
apparently drew in the absence of the facts now in the record. See Reply in Support of Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs at 12 (July 11, 2011) [ECF No. 10].
II.

THE COURT’S PUBLIC-BENEFIT FINDING CANNOT BE SUSTAINED ON
ANY OF THE COURT’S OTHER CONSIDERATIONS .
Although the Court apparently considered other factors besides the erroneous negative

inference, none is sufficient to sustain the finding of a public benefit. See Mem. Op. at 10-11.
Specifically, the Court considered the fact that Plaintiff’s February 26, 2010 request “was
intended to ‘inform the public about whether and to what extent the destruction of these email[s]
may have violated DOJ policy and federal laws’”; that “[i]n granting CREW’s request for
expedited processing of the February 26th request, DOJ acknowledged that the question involved
was a ‘matter of widespread and exceptional media interest’”; and that the produced documents
“were not available to the public prior to CREW’s requests.” Mem. Op. at 10. The first of these
7

Case 1:10-cv-00750-JEB Document 12 Filed 11/04/11 Page 8 of 11

considerations – the request itself – is insufficient because “it is the benefit that derives from the
litigation not simply the request that is considered.” Horsehead Indus., Inc. v. EPA, 999 F. Supp.
59, 68-69 (D.D.C. 1998); see also Chesapeake Bay Found. v. Department of Agric., 108 F.3d
375, 377 (D.C. Cir. 1997). For similar reasons, the second of the Court’s considerations – the
Department’s granting expedited processing based on the perceived interest in the subject-matter
of the request – is not basis to find a public benefit from this lawsuit. Finally, and most
significantly, the third consideration – the Department’s production of documents responsive to
Plaintiff’s February 26, 2010 request – is irrelevant to the Court’s fee analysis because the
Department completed processing that request before the August 2, 2010 order on which this
Court predicated Plaintiff’s eligibility for fees. Compare Colborn Decl. ¶ 15 (explaining that
“OLC completed its search for documents responsive to the [] narrowed February 26 Request,
and by letter dated July 23, 2010, [] informed CREW that OLC had found no responsive
documents” and thus “[t]his litigation was thereafter focused exclusively on CREW’s March 3
Request”) with Mem. Op. at 5 (concluding that Plaintiff was eligible for fees “because it obtained
relief through a judicial order”). Indeed, for that reason, no aspect of Plaintiff’s February 26,
2010 request has bearing on the Court’s fee determination. Thus, the Court’s public-benefit
finding necessarily hinges on the erroneous negative inference, and therefore Plaintiff’s
entitlement to fees should be revisited.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Department of Justice respectfully requests that the Court
reconsider its determination that Plaintiff is entitled to fees and conclude that no public benefit
was derived from this lawsuit.
