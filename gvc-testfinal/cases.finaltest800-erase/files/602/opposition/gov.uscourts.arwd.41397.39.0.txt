PARTIAL RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS AND
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FULLY RESPOND

Comes now the Plaintiffs, Loren Janes and Janes, Inc., by and through their attorney, Joe D.
Byars, Jr., of Byars, Hickey & Hall, PLLC, and files this partial response in opposition to
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 31, 32) and motion for extension of time to fully respond, and
in support thereof, states and alleges as follows:
1.

Plaintiffs deny that Separate Defendants, SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. f/k/a

AIG SunAmerica Asset Mgt. Corp. and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica
Capital Services, Inc., are entitled to dismissal.
2.

The Amended Complaint (Doc. 21) filed herein on June 12, 2013, accurately and

sufficiently sets forth causes of action against Separate Defendants, identifying the Defendants
among the confusing array of entities which may be affiliates of AIG, but no longer using AIG in
their names.

Procedural Status
3.

On July 29, 2013, Defendants, SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. f/k/a AIG

SunAmerica Asset Mgt. Corp. and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica
Capital Services, Inc. (Sometimes collectively referenced herein as “SunAmerica”), filed their
Motion to Dismiss, purportedly under Rule 12(b)(6). While the Defendants designated their motion
as a motion to dismiss, the reality is that Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment by
requesting the court to consider documents attached in support of the motion, including two
unauthenticated hearsay documents attached as Exhibits “A” and “B” to the Defendants’ motion.
Exhibit “A” to Defendants’ motion is represented to be a “FINRA broker check” showing William
Jackson Moates, Jr., as “not registered” with FINRA, yet shows a “registration history” with
American General Securities, Incorporated from October 2002 through October of 2008, and “Sage
Point Financial, Inc.” from the time frame of October of 2008 through February of 2009. This report
also reflects “employment dates” for William Moates apparently reflecting that Moates was an
employee various entities affiliated or related to AIG (American International Group), such as AIG
Financial Advisors, Inc.; AIG American General Life Insurance Company; and American General
Securities, Incorporated. See Defendants’ Exhibit A (document 32-1, Page ID# 213). The Defendants
also rely upon another unauthenticated hearsay document labeled Exhibit “B” (document 32-2, Page
ID# 220) which purports to be a “producer license report” reflecting various associations of William
Moates, including American General Insurance Agency, Inc., and American General Life Insurance
Company, among others.
The Defendants would have this Court consider the documents, and assume as true the
statements made by the Defendants as to the significance of the attached documents. Accordingly,

Page 2 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 3 of 19 PageID #: 234

these documents are clearly matters “outside the pleadings” which must be necessary for the Court
to consider in passing on the motion. “Under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted must be treated as a
summary judgment when matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded by the trial
court.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); e.g. Mazaleski v. Treusdell, 562 F.2d 701 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Abrahamson
v. Mitchell, 459 F.2d 955 (8th Cir. 1972). Thus, since the Defendants have filed documents in support
of their motion to dismiss, the district court must treat the motion as one for summary judgment
unless it decides to exclude the documents in considering the motion. See, for example, Dayco Corp.
v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 523 F.2d 389 (6th Cir. 1975). Woods v. Dugan, 660 F.2d 379, 380
(8th Cir. 1981). In this regard, the Plaintiffs request the Court to either exclude the documents
attached to Defendants’ motion and rule upon Defendants’ motion to dismiss without such
supporting documentation, or alternatively, to treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment
and provide the Plaintiffs with a reasonable period of time in which to conduct sufficient discovery
which would enable the Plaintiffs to fully respond to the motion. “When a motion to dismiss is
treated as a motion for summary judgment, Rule 12 provides for its disposition pursuant to Rule 56.”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Rule 12 further provides that “all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity
to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.” Id.
4.

It is clear that a trial court must give the parties an adequate amount of time to

conduct discovery before ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Specifically, “Rule 56(f) allows
a party opposing summary judgment to seek a continuance and postpone a summary judgment
decision until adequate discovery has been completed. When seeking such a continuance, the party

Page 3 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 235

opposing summary judgment must file an affidavit with the trial court to show what specific facts
further discovery might unveil.” Dulany v. Carnahan, 132 F.3d 1234, 1238 (8th Cir. 1997).
5.

Attached is an affidavit of Loren Janes, demonstrating the need for the Plaintiff to

conduct discovery in order to ascertain the relationships between Loren Janes, Janes, Inc., William
J. Moates, and Defendants, SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica Asset Mgt.
Corp. and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc., and the
entities identified in the Defendants’ documents, which appear to be entities related to, and on
information and belief, are related to AIG SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. Attached to the
affidavit of Loren Janes are copies of proposed interrogatories and document requests which
Plaintiffs desire to serve upon the Defendants and Mr. Moates in order to ascertain the relationships
between Separate Defendants SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica Asset
Mgt. Corp. and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. f/k/a AIG SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. and
the parties identified as “employers” of William J. Moates, including American General Life
Insurance Company (see Defendant’s Exhibit “B”), and American General Securities, Incorporated.
As stated by Loren Janes in his affidavit, Mr. Janes received periodic statements with respect to his
Sun America account which listed the “Representative Name” as William Moates and which listed
William J. Moates, Jr., as the financial representative on statements specific to the 401(k) account
number 93149322, and which also reference “AIG Financial Advisors, Inc.” as the “financial
representative.” (See Janes Affidavit, Exhibit “A”, P. 3-4) As late as May 31, 2012, SunAmerica
issued statements to Loren Janes, or Janes, Inc., holding out “William J. Moates” as the “Financial
Representative,” with apparent authority to act for SunAmerica. (See Janes’ affidavit, Ex. “C”).
Based upon the facts stated in Mr. Janes’ affidavit, it appears clear that there has been, and may have

Page 4 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 5 of 19 PageID #: 236

been, at the relevant time periods, substantial relationships between AIG Financial Advisors, Inc.,
William Moates, AIG Sun America, Capital Services, Inc., and/or other AIG affiliates utilizing the
name “SunAmerica.” See also, Janes Affidavit, Exhibit A. The Plaintiffs should have an adequate
opportunity to conduct discovery into the “shell game” apparently practiced by AIG, and
SunAmerica. The names of the entities are confusingly similar, and as such, discovery is necessary
to determine the true relationships between the parties.
Argument
6.

Fundamental to the Court’s determination on a motion to dismiss is that the

allegations asserted by the Plaintiffs are accepted as true. It appears that the Defendant has simply
chosen to ignore multiple allegations set out in the Plaintiff’s complaint, including the facts stated
in paragraphs 10 through 32 of the complaint, in which William J. Moates is described as acting
“under the control of Defendants SAAMCo, and/or SunAmerica Capital, and that Separate
Defendants permitted and facilitated in the transfer of Mr. Janes’ account without taking reasonable
precautions to obtain and/ or verify the authority of the person causing the transfer of funds.
Pursuant to paragraphs 11 through 18 of the complaint, Moates represented to Janes that the
amount of $85,600.00 of Janes’ funds would be deposited into a “SunAmerica” account (Account
No. 9314932), yet Moates, on behalf of and acting for and/or with the assistance of the Defendants,
SunAmerica, caused the funds to be deposited with HR Administration, Inc., knowing (or they
should have known) HR Administration, Inc., was owned and/or operated and/or controlled by
Robert Hague Rogers, who was known to be untrustworthy and leaving the deposit at a very high
degree of risk of loss.

Page 5 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 237

In paragraph 15 of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Separate Defendants
knew or should have known that the entire account balance of $157,078.30 was withdrawn from the
401(k) account held by Janes, Inc., “yet failed to notify Janes, Inc., and/or Loren Janes of the
complete withdrawal of the funds.”
Moreover, paragraph 15 of the complaint demonstrates that the actions of Moates and
Separate Defendants, SAAMCo. and SunAmerica Capital were performed “without the knowledge
or consent of Janes, Inc., and/or Loren Janes” and that such actions were concealed from the
Plaintiffs. These are the specific acts of conduct which constitute the acts, misrepresentations and
omissions which Plaintiffs contend to constitute a manipulative and/or deceptive device in violation
of §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.
7.

Sun America has stated four specific arguments as to why the Plaintiffs allegations

fail to state a claim, which will be addressed in turn:
1)

Negligence. Defendants first assert that Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails

to state a claim for negligence because there is no support under Arkansas common law for the
notion that a broker-dealer or the issuer or “portfolio manager” of a financial account owes a duty
to its account owners to verify the authority of a person transferring funds or to obtain consent to do
so on behalf of the account owner. Basic concepts of “duty” under common law negligence certainly
support the common sense notion that a broker-dealer or issuer of a financial account does have a
duty to verify the identity and authority of a person draining over $150,000.00 from an account.
“Duty is a concept which arises out of the recognition that relations between individuals may impose
upon one a legal obligation for another.” Shannon v. Wilson, 329 Ark. 143, 947 S.W.2d 349 (1997),
citing Prosser, Handbook on the Law of Torts, §42 at 244 (4th Ed. 1971). In the commercial setting,

Page 6 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 238

it is often stated that a bank or financial company must act in a “commercially reasonable manner,”
or must adhere to reasonable commercial standards in dealing with an account. See, for example,
First Bank & Trust of Jonesboro v. Vaccari, 288 Ark. 233, 702 S.W.2d 867 (1986).
In First Bank, supra, the Arkansas Supreme Court cited, with approval, the case of Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co. V. Hepler State Bank, 6 Kan.App.2d 543, 630 P.2d 721 (1981), where the
court actually held that as a matter of law, it is commercially unreasonable for a bank to accept for
deposit in an individual account a check made payable to a corporation without first ascertaining,
or at least making an inquiry as to the authority of the depositor/endorser. First Bank, 288 Ark. At
236; 703 S.W.2d at 869. By close analogy, a financial organization providing and holding 401(k)
accounts owe a similar duty to make inquiry as to the authority of a person closing out or transferring
the entire balance of an account with a value in excess of $150,000.00. It has been pled that there is
a relationship between Plaintiffs and Defendants whereby Janes and Janes, Inc. invested in securities
issued by SAAMCo and/or SunAmerica Capital (Amended Complaint, ¶11A) as a 401(k) account
and/or mutual fund account. Given the relationship of the parties, it is axiomatic that a duty is owed
by virtue of the relationship between the parties. Common and accepted commercial standards
require those in the position of Defendants to make some effort to verify the identity and authority
of a person transferring an amount in excess of $150,000.00 from an account – at least under the
circumstances in existence in this case. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a cause of
action for negligence; or should be given the opportunity to re-plead, as such would not be “futile.”
It is essentially undisputed that a relationship between Plaintiffs and Separate Defendants does exist.
The nature of the relationship alleged creates legal duties.

2)

Filed 08/26/13 Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 239

Conversion. Defendants next assert that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim

for conversion. Defendants take a strained reading of the Complaint in order to “limit” or attempt
to limit the true allegations. Clearly with respect to the account balance of $157,078.30, the Plaintiffs
have alleged that such sum was on deposit or held in an account with the Defendants, and that the
Defendants “SAAMCo and SunAmerica Capital knew or should have known that the Plaintiffs’
investment needs and objectives were to hold the funds in question in the existing 401(k) account
which Janes, Inc. had with SunAmerica, which funds were not to be transferred or sold without the
express written consent of the Plaintiffs.” (Amended Complaint, ¶ 14). It was specifically alleged
that the funds were to be held in accordance with the terms of the account issued by Defendants, but
that “with the cooperation and assistance of SAAMCo and SunAmerica Capital” (Amended
Complaint ¶14), and further, that “SAAMCo and SunAmerica Capital permitted and facilitated the
transfer of the proceeds of the account without taking reasonable precautions under the
circumstances to obtain and/or verify the identity and authority of the person causing the transfer of
the funds, which was done without the knowledge or consent of [Plaintiffs]” (Amended Complaint
¶16). At ¶22 it is further alleged that Defendants “and each of them, wrongfully and fraudulently
assumed control over the securities in Plaintiffs’ account with SunAmerica, and wrongfully and
without Plaintiffs’ knowledge . . . transferred Plaintiffs’ account.” (Amended Complaint ¶22).
Clearly there are specific and sufficient allegations to support a claim for conversion against Separate
Defendants.
The “dominion” over the account comes from the nature of the relationship and that
Defendants must have participated in the transfer of the funds. After all, the Defendants issued the
“Redemption Check” in te amount of $157,078.30. The problem for the Defendants is that the

Page 8 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 9 of 19 PageID #: 240

transfer was never authorized by the Plaintiffs. Defendants participation in the conversion creates
liability. Accordingly, Defendants motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim for conversion should be
denied; or alternatively, Plaintiff should be given the opportunity to re-plead, as it has not been
shown that the same would be “futile.”
3)

Respondeat Superior. The Plaintiffs have alleged certain facts based upon

their knowledge and belief. As seen from the Affidavit of Loren Janes, and particularly the exhibits
attached thereto, William Moates is identified as the “representative” on multiple statements issued
by SunAmerica to Janes Inc. over a period of multiple years – even as late as May 31, 2012. (Ex. C,
Affidavit of Loren Janes.) As explained in the Affidavit of Mr. Janes, discovery is needed to allow
for further inquiry and investigation as to the relationship between William Moates and the
SunAmerica Defendants. While after discovery it may be determined William Moates was not an
authorized representative or employee of the Separate Defendants, it is too early to summarily
dismiss the claims on this basis. It is apparent that the Defendants permitted or continued to hold Mr.
Moates out as a “Financial Representative” on statements issued by SunAmerica through at least
May 31, 2012. (Ex. C, Affidavit of Loren Janes.)
4)

Securities Laws Violations. The Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed

to state a claim under the securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Security and Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10-b-5. In support, Defendants first claim that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently
allege a misrepresentation or omission “in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.” Once
again, the Defendants have focused on one part of the Complaint in an effort to establish a straw man
to knock down. The Complaint against Defendants is not limited to the misdirection of the
$85,600.00 check, but also the fraudulent transfer and withdrawal of the entire balance of the 401(k)

Page 9 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 241

account which had been held by SunAmerica. Nevertheless, in addressing the argument concerning
the “check,” the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action.
Defendants rely on the case of Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 731
(1975) (and a 7th Circuit Case citing Blue Chip Stamps) to argue that since the Plaintiff did not
actually obtain an additional contribution to his SunAmerica 401(k) account or mutual fund, then
Plaintiff cannot prove a fraud “in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.” (Defendants’
Brief. Pg. 9-11). This argument is misplaced. In Blue Chip, the Supreme Court held that the
Securities Exchange “Act does not protect a person who did not actually buy securities, but who
might have done so had the seller told the truth.” Wharf Holdings, Ltd. v. United Intern. Holdings,
Inc., 532 U.S. 588, 594, 121 S.Ct. 1776 (2001) citing Blue Chip Stamps. Our case is different,
because the $85,600.00 check was, in fact, used to purchase a security. In Blue Chip, the Plaintiff
argued that the Defendant intentionally prepared a pessimistic prospectus to discourage the purchase
of securities, so that the securities could be sold to the public later at a higher price. No securities
were purchased. In our case, however, Moates did represent to Plaintiff, Janes, Inc., that a
contribution to the existing security account issued by SunAmerica would be purchased and a
different security was purchased instead. The Supreme Court in Wharf, distinguishes Blue Chip
Stamps, and presents a situation closer to the facts at hand. In Wharf, the question was whether a
company which sold an option to buy stock while secretly intending to never honor the option
violates Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act. The Supreme Court concluded that such
conduct did. Furthermore, it is clear from such case that a “security” includes both “any . . . option
. . . on any security” and “any . . . right to . . . purchase” stock. In this case, it is alleged that Moates,
while acting for SunAmerica, sold to Janes, Inc. an “option” to purchase a further interest in the

Page 10 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 242

existing account, but had the secret intention to misdirect the funds, and not honor the “option.” In
Wharf, as in this case, the agreement to purchase additional shares was an oral agreement. In Wharf,
the court recognized that the Plaintiff, United was not a “potential buyer, because by providing
Wharf with its service, it actually bought the option that Wharf sold.” Here, it is absolutely true that
Janes Inc. actually paid $85,600.00 to purchase what was offered by Moates. It is not a case where
Janes, Inc. is alleging that it “would have” or “might have” purchased a security had the seller told
the truth. As noted in Wharf, “oral contracts for the sale of securities are sufficiently common that
the Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every state now consider them enforceable.”
Wharf, 532 U.S. at 595.
Another case similar to the facts at hand is SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 122 S.Ct. 1899
(2002), where a securities broker misappropriated the proceeds from the sale of a customer’s
securities was found to be a fraud “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security” in
violation of §10(b) of the Act. “In its role enforcing the Act, the SEC has consistently adopted a
broad reading of the phrase ‘in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.’ It has
maintained that a broker who accepts payment for securities that he never intends to deliver, or who
sells customer securities with intent to misappropriate the proceeds, violates §10(b) and Rule 10b-5.”
Zandford, 535 U.S. at 819. See also Grippo v. Perazzo, 357 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir. 2004), where the
court concluded that the plaintiff adequately pled “in connection with the purchase or sale of any
security even though he failed to identify any particular security purchased, because [the Defendant]
accepted and deposited the [Plaintiff’s] monies as payment for securities.” The same situation is
presented here, as alleged in Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint. Grippo v. Perazzo, 357 F.3d 1218,

Page 11 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 243

1224 (11th Circ. 2004). See also Schnorr v. Schubert, 2005 WL 2019878 (W.D. Okl. 2005),
discussing SEC v. Zandford and Blue Chip Stamps, supra.
Defendants also claim that the transfer (complete withdrawal) from the SunAmerica account
to another account “was not done in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,” but the
Defendants cite no case law to support the argument. The statute cited by Defendants, 15 U.S.C. §
78c(a)(10) is of no help either. Plaintiffs reference the case of Colbert & Winstead, PC 401(k) Plan
v. AIG Financial Advisors, Inc., 2008 WL 2704367 (M.D. Tenn 2008), in which the Court found that
Defendant’s motion to dismiss state and federal securities claims related to a 401(k) account which
was essentially stolen by a rogue agent would not be dismissed. The argument that a 401(k) account
is not a “security,” but is admittedly composed of securities is a unique argument which apparently
has not been addressed directly in a published case – particularly within the Eighth Circuit. However,
such argument makes little sense. When the Court examines 15 U.S.C. §78(c)(a)(10), it will note that
included in the description of a “security” is a “. . . group or index of securities” – which is
essentially how the Defendants describe the account, to wit: “Although a 401(k) account may contain
securities, they do not have to . . .” (Def. Br. Pg. 11). The affidavit of Loren Janes, attached hereto,
includes statements from SunAmerica which clearly list a number of securities accounts,
accordingly, there is evidence that the 401(k) account in this case does include securities.
The “who, what, when, and how” are simple in this case, and are alleged with specificity in
paragraphs 10-22 of the Amended Complaint. There are two basic transactions, the specifics of
which have been identified. The details of the transactions, including the extent to which
representatives of Defendants participated with Moates in transferring the 401(k) account are still
unknown to Plaintiffs, which is the reason why time is needed to conduct discovery.

Filed 08/26/13 Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 244

Plaintiff urges the Court to examine Zandford, and cases which rely upon such Supreme
Court Case. Plaintiff respectfully submits that Zandford supports the notion that Plaintiff’s claims
do fall within the prohibition of 10(b) of the Act. Clearly, the circumstances pled by the Plaintiff in
this case are sufficient to meet the element of a fraud “in connection with the purchase or sale of a
security,” for the reasons discussed above.
5)

Agency under Arkansas Law. As mentioned above, Plaintiffs have alleged

certain facts based upon the limited knowledge Plaintiffs now have. The Affidavit of Loren Janes
includes attachments referencing William Moates as the “representative” on statements issued by
SunAmerica as late as May 31, 2012. These were submitted by SunAmerica repeatedly, and based
upon the Affidavit of Loren Janes, one may reasonably conclude that William Moates was “held out”
by Defendants as having a representative capacity. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that they have
alleged sufficient facts to establish agency, or at least enough to fairly put the Defendants on notice
of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs. In this regard, Plaintiffs need time to engage in discovery to
ascertain the extent of the relationship between Moates and the other Defendants and when and how
all the Defendants communicated their relationship status to Plaintiffs.
Accordingly, in the event this Court does not enter an order denying Defendant’s motion to
dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff respectfully requests an order permitting the
parties to engage in discovery for a reasonable period of time such that the Plaintiff may fully
respond to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
6)

Control Person Liability. The Plaintiff has, in fact, pled sufficient facts to

support “control person” liability in this case on the part of the SunAmerica defendants.

Page 13 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 245

Defendants first allege Plaintiffs have “failed to adequately plead multiple elements required
for 10b and Rule 10b-5 violations including causation and that the alleged acts were committed ‘in
connection with the purchase or sale of a security.’” (Def. Br. Pg. 13). Defendants have accurately
recited the elements for control person liability from Lustgraaf v. Behrens, 619 F.3d 867, 873 (8th
Cir. 2010) (the primary case cited in their brief), but additional discussion of Lustgraaf helps to
illustrate that the current pleading of Plaintiffs adequately state a claim.
In Lustgraaf, the court summarized and discussed the pleadings as follows:
“The complaints specify Behrens’s alleged false statements: that he
would invest Appellants’ funds and provide them with a steady
stream of returns. It also alleges facts sufficient to support an
inference that those statements were false at the time they were made:
rather than investing the funds, Behrens misappropriated them for
other uses . . . Finally, the Complaints allege dates on which
Appellant’s made their investments with Behrens and the amounts of
those investments. Thus, the operative complaints articulate the ‘who,
what, when, where and how’ of the alleged misleading statements.”
Lustgraaf, 619 F.3d at 874.

Here, the facts are similar and remarkably simple. Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Moates
informed Plaintiffs that he would use the funds paid by Janes, Inc. to purchase a further interest
(make a contribution) in his existing 401(k) account with SunAmerica (Am. Complaint ¶ 11A-C).
Contrary to this representation, the funds were diverted to HR Administration, Inc. and/or HR
Financial Services, Inc., which were corporations owned and/or operated by Robert Hague-Rogers.
(Am. Complaint ¶12). Further, the complaint alleges that Moates and SunAmerica knew that Janes,
Inc. desired to maintain his existing accounts with SunAmerica – not to be transferred, or sold
without his consent. (Am. Complaint ¶14). The complaint clearly states dates and amounts of the
monies contributed by Janes, Inc., in reliance on these statements and agreement. (Am. Complaint

Page 14 of 19

Case 2:13-cv-02049-PKH Document 39

Filed 08/26/13 Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 246

¶¶ 11, 12, 14, 15). Instead of doing what he represented to Janes, Inc., Moates, with the participation
of SunAmerica, misdirected the funds, which were ultimately lost. Accordingly, the Amended
Complaint sufficiently alleges facts to support that a “primary violater” – Moates, violated the
securities laws.
The Defendants next rely upon the exhibits to its Motion to Dismiss, arguing that Plaintiffs
resort to “baseless and conclusory allegations that the SunAmerica defendants are broker-dealers,
and that Moates is an agent, employee or representative of the SunAmerica defendants. Once again,
the Lustgraaf case is instructive, as the court discussed control liability as follows:
“Broker-dealers exercise considerable control over their
representatives, both in the sense that their association allows
representatives legal access to securities markets, 15 U.S.C.
§78o(a)(1),3 and in the sense that the securities laws require brokerdealers to establish oversight systems to monitor representatives’
activities, id. §78o(b)(4)(E)(i).4 Thus, although Behrens’s fraud did
not take place through Sunset, it is Sunset that effectively provided
Behrens access to the markets, and Sunset that had the duty to
monitor his activities. Behrens could not have perpetrated his
fraudulent scheme absent Appellants’ belief that he had access to
these markets. Sunset had the responsibility to oversee Behrens’s
activity with respect to his actions as a registered representative.”
Lustgraaf v. Behrens, 619 F.3d at 876.
Similarly, in our case, the fraud of Moates in diverting the funds to an unknown,
unauthorized third party could not have taken place without the participation and assistance of
SunAmerica. As alleged in ¶ 14 of the Amended Complaint: “William J. Moates . . . with the
cooperation and assistance of SAAMCo and SunAmerica Capital, caused the entire balance of the
funds held by Separate Defendants, SAAMCo and/or SunAmerica Capital, to be withdrawn on or
about March 24, 2011, by virtue of a “redemption check” issued by SunAmerica Money Market
check #609524, account #9314932, under dealer #1012, in an amount equal to $157,078.30.”

SunAmerica was in a position to control and monitor the activities of Moates, and to verify his
authority as of the time this check was issued by SunAmerica. SunAmerica was certainly in “control”
of the issuance of the “redemption check.” It is significant to note that “Congress did not define the
meaning of control” in the context of control-person liability. Lutgraaf, 619 F.3d at 873, citing H.R.
Rep. No. 73-1383 at 26 (1934), (“It was thought undesirable to attempt to define [control]. It would
be difficult, if not impossible, to enumerate or anticipate the many ways in which actual control may
be exerted) . . .” Importantly, “Culpable participation by the alleged control person in the primary
violation is not part of plaintiffs prima facie case.” Id. 619 F.3d at 873-874. Certainly, under the facts
asserted here, the SunAmerica Defendants knew of the transaction, since they issued the redemption
check. Was the redemption check issued because of the relationship between SunAmerica and
Moates? While the Defendants allege that Moates was not their agent or representative, there are
facts that demonstrate otherwise. See the Affidavit of Loren Janes, with the attached statements
essentially holding Moates out as a SunAmerica representative.
There are sufficient facts pled to demonstrate that Moates was acting under the apparent
authority of SunAmerica, even if the formal relationship had ended. The Eighth Circuit summarized
the proof Arkansas requires for a finding of apparent authority, as follows:
“Two elements must be established to support a showing of apparent
authority: (1) that the principal held the agent out to the public as
possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in
question, or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority;
and (2) that the person dealing with the agent knew of the facts and
acting in good faith had reason to believe and did believe that the
agent possessed the necessary authority.” Farley v. Henson, 11 F.3d
827, 832 (8th Cir. 1993), citing Wal-Mart Stores v. Crist, 855 F.2d
1326, 1331 (8th Cir. 1988), quoting Central Surety & Ins. Corp. v.
O&S Wholesale, 193 Ark. 523, 101 S.W.2d 167, 172 (1937).

The Farley & Henson case also shows that an entity does not necessarily have to be a
“broker-dealer” to have liability under the securities laws. Control-person liability is also created by
15 U.S.C. §77o, which says, in part, that: “any person that knowingly or recklessly provides
substantial assistance to another person in violation of a provision of this subchapter, or any rule or
regulation issued under this subchapter, shall be deemed to be in violation of such provision to the
same extent as the person to whom such assistance is provided.” See Farley v. Henson, 11 F.3d 827,
836 (8th Cir. 1993). Moreover, as explained in Farley, the Arkansas Securities Act “tracks federal
law,” and accordingly, the separate state securities statutes need not be addressed or pled, unless the
court so directs or allows. Id., 11 F.3d at 837.
Leave to Amend
8.

Plaintiff’s disagree with Defendants’ assertion that a request for leave to amend

would be “futile,” and particularly that “Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is clear proof of Plaintiffs’
repeated failure to state a claim.”(Def. Br. Pg. 15). Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint after
the Plaintiffs recognized that the source of the “redemption check” was from Plaintiffs’
“SunAmerica” 401(k) account, as opposed to Plaintiffs’ annuity account. Plaintiff simply had two
accounts with SunAmerica, and the undersigned counsel had inadvertently confused the account
numbers at issue. The Amended Complaint was, by no means, an attempt to “remedy” any alleged
deficiencies in pleading. With that said, Plaintiffs respectfully request the opportunity to re-plead in
the event the court finds deficiencies in the sufficiency of the pleadings.
Proof
9.

This partial response is supported by the affidavit of the Plaintiff, Loren Janes,

attached as Exhibit A.

Conclusion
10.

For the reasons stated herein, the Defendant’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative

motion for summary judgment must be denied; or alternatively, this Court should enter an order
denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss and allowing Plaintiff to engage in reasonable discovery to
supplement and to fully respond to the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Plaintiffs respectfully request that Defendants’ Motion
to Dismiss be denied; and, in the event Defendants’ motion is considered by the Court to be a Motion
for Summary Judgment, that Plaintiffs be given the opportunity to engage in reasonable discovery
before being compelled to further respond to this motion, and that an extension of time be granted
for discovery; and/or that Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment be denied; and/or that
Plaintiffs be given an opportunity to re-plead in the event the Court finds deficiencies in the
Complaint, and for such other and further relief to which Plaintiffs may be entitled to receive.
