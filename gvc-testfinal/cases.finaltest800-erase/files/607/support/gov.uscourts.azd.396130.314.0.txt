Daniel David Rigmaiden
Pro Se, Defendant

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF ARIZONA

United States of America, No. CRO8-814-PHX-DGC

Plaintiff, MOTION FOR PRESERVATION AND
INVENTORY OF ROUGH
INVESTIGATION NOTES RELATING TO
THE AIRCARD LOCATING MISSION

Ve
Daniel David Rigmaiden

Defendant.

VN ee ee

 

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se,
respectfully requests that the Court enter an Order directing all

law enforcement agents and government attorneys who were involved

rough notes created during the course of the investigation to
locate the aircard or in furtherance of the investigation to
locate the aircard. This request includes, but is not limited to,
those notes made, directly or indirectly, as a result of this
investigation notwithstanding whether or not the contents of said
notes have been incorporated into any official report. Further,

the defendant requests that the government be required to prepare

 

1. The aircard is a "UTStarcom PC5740 Broadband Connection Card" associated
with Verizon Wireless account No. 270691733 opened under the name of Travis
Rupard. The government claims to have electronically located the aircard on
July 16, 2008 and physically located the aircard on August 3, 2008.

an inventory list of all rough notes taken with respect to the
aircard locating mission and provide that list to the defendant
immediately.

As grounds therefore, the defendant shows, as follows:

1. This motion does not demand, at this time, disclosure,
discovery, inspection, or production of any specific rough notes.
It merely seeks to preserve evidence, directly admissible or
otherwise and other information which may, at some future stage of
the proceedings, be necessary or helpful to a proper resolution of
this case consistent with the defendant's theory of defense.

2. This motion is being made so that the Court can determine
whether disclosure of said notes is required under Brady v.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235

 

F.3d 453 (9th Cir. 2000), and Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) and
(i). There is a realistic possibility that the Court will be asked
to determine whether the disclosure of said notes is required

prior to the defendant filin his motion(s.) tosup

3. This request includes the preservation of the prosecutors'
notes relating to his/her mental impressions and opinions relating
to the aircard locating mission. In Morris v. Ylst, the Ninth
Circuit held that a prosecutor's Opinions and mental impressions
of a case are discoverable if "they contain underlying exculpatory
facts." Id., 447 F.3d 735, 742 (9th Cir. 2006). The government has

already indicated to the defendant that they destroyed some of the

 

2. There were two federal prosecutors involved in the aircard locating
mission: (1) AUSA Shawna Yen out of the Northern District of California and,
(2) AUSA Frederick A. Battista out of the District of Arizona.

evidence obtained during the aircard locating mission. Notes

by the prosecutors relating to the aircard locating mission may be
the only way for the defendant to obtain comparable evidence to
support his motion(s) to suppress the evidence resulting from the
aircard locating mission.

4. An inventory of the rough notes and a statement of the
circumstances under which they were prepared will allow the
defendant to evaluate whether motions should be filed for
production of the notes in advance of filing a motion to suppress,
and will prevent unnecessary delay which would be caused by
motions made during the course of a possible suppression hearing
for such production.

5. As of this motion, the government is on notice that any
destruction of rough notes relating to the aircard locating
mission cannot be in good faith as of this time forward.

The defendant respectfully requests that the Court enter an

attorneys who were involved in the aircard locating mission to

retain and preserve all rough notes created during the course of
the investigation to locate the aircard or in furtherance of the
investigation to locate the aircard, (2) the government to prepare
an inventory list of all rough notes referred to in No. 1 above,
and (3) the government to immediately provide the defendant with

the inventory list referred to in No. 2 above.

The defendant is appearing pro se and has no formal legal
training whatsoever. The defendant's filings, however inartfully
pleaded, must be liberally construed and held to less stringent
standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v.
Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).

Based on the facts, points, and authorities set forth herein,
the defendant respectfully requests that this motion be granted.

LRCrim 12.2(a) requires that the undersigned include the
following statement in all motions: "Excludable delay under
18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3161(h)(1)(D) will occur as a result of this motion or
of an order based thereon." However, the defendant posits that
this motion will not cause any "delay" and objects to any delay as
a result of this motion or of an order based thereon.
