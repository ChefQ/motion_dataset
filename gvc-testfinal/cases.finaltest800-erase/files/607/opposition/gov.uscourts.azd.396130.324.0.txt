Memorandum

2 I.

Discussion

3

In brief, defendant Daniel David Rigmaiden is in the process of requesting specific items

4 through the discovery process as they relate to the government’s location of a particular Verizon
5 Broadband Access Card (the “Aircard”). It is the position of the government that the subject
6 card was used to file the fraudulent federal tax returns which form the central basis of this
7 criminal case. Summarizing in the most general and basic terms, it appears that defendant
8 intends to challenge the manner in which the Aircard was located by the government and
9 ultimately seek to suppress the evidence the government gathered via search warrants once the
10 Aircard was located. In order to assist defendant in gathering all of the material subject to
11 disclosure with respect to this issue, the government has been seeking to respond to defendant’s
12 requests in due course, the sole area in which it has informed defendant that it will not generally
13 comply relates to the actual operation of the device which allowed the government to locate the
14 Aircard within a certain area but not specifically within defendant’s apartment.
15

In light of the facts that (1) this issue appears to be central to defendant’s defense, and (2)

16 the government is required to withhold certain other sensitive materials related to the operation
17 of the subject detention device, the government is willing to turn over all available agent notes
18 with respect to this narrow issue, subject to the redaction regimen it has been following in the
19 case to date, to defendant upon receipt and review. Upon receipt of defendant Rigmaiden’s
20 motion, the government commenced the process of specifically seeking to gather and segregate
21 the subject notes and will disclose whatever is available shortly. Erring on the side of caution,
22 all such agents will be advised to not destroy any notes in existence relating to this case. All
23 agents who participated in the physical location the Aircard in defendant Rigmaiden’s apartment
24 have been directed to provide copies of their notes which will be processed for purposes of
25 discovery. This agreement to disclose does not apply to the agent/technicians who operated the
26 subject detection device. However, the government will advise defendant via an inventory if any
27 such notes exist.

With respect to defendant’s request for prosecutor’s notes with respect to this issue

2 (AUSA Frederick A. Battista, District of Arizona and AUSA Shawn Yen, Northern District of
3 California) defendant cites Morris v. Ylst, 447 F.3d 735, 742 (9th Cir. 2006), which holds “Thus,
4 in general, a prosecutor’s opinions and mental impressions of the case are not discoverable under
5 Brady unless they contain underlying exculpatory facts.” In response to defendant’s request,
6 AUSA Yen has advised AUSA Battista that she does not possess any notes relating to this case.
7 With respect to AUSA Battista, he will examine any notes in his possession and provide
8 defendant with an inventory of any notes pertaining to this issue that contain underlying
9 exculpatory facts not fully disclosed via an agent report or some other document. AUSA Battista
10 agrees to not destroy any such notes, if they exist, in his possession.
11 II.

Conclusion

12

For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s Motion for Preservation of Rough Notes Relating

13 to the Aircard Mission should be denied as moot.
14

Respectfully submitted this 12th day of July, 2010.
