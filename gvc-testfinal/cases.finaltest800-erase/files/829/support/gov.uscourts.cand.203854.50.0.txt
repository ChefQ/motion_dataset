MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES
I.

3

INTRODUCTION
The Court dismissed Plaintiff’s original complaint on the ground that Section 230 of the

4

Communications Decency Act of 1996 (the “CDA” or “Section 230”) barred each of her claims.

5

Docket No. 48. In its Order, the Court held that Google is an interactive computer service

6

provider for purposes of Section 230, and that each of Plaintiff’s claims sought to hold Google

7

liable for the publication of third-party content, precisely the liability Section 230 proscribes. Id.

8

at 4 n.2, 13. In granting Plaintiff leave to amend, the Court cautioned Plaintiff that any new

9

complaint must allege facts that “make it very clear that [Google] directly participates in

10

developing the illegality’ at issue.” Id. at 6 (quoting Fair Housing Council of San Fernando

11

Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1174 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (“Roommates”)).1

12

Plaintiff has ignored the Court’s admonition. Instead, her Amended Complaint is rife with

13

conclusory, unsupported (and outlandish) allegations that Google “controlled much of the

14

underlying commercial activity” of its advertisers, “substantially participates in the creation of

15

AdWords ads,” “encourages illegal content” and “effectively requires advertisers to engage in

16

illegal conduct.” Docket No. 49, ¶¶ 19, 21.2 Plaintiff alleges no facts that would, if proven,

17

establish that Google is the “information content provider” of the offending statements and, as a

18

consequence, Section 230 continues to bar her claims, and the amended complaint should be

19

dismissed.

20

Plaintiff alleges that the “Keyword Tool” features of Google’s AdWords product result in

21

“collaboration” by Google in the development of illegal content. This argument is not only

22

without foundation, the Ninth Circuit has already rejected it twice, holding expressly that the

23

provision of neutral tools, such as keyword generation tools from which advertisers may choose

24

their keywords, does not deprive a website of Section 230 immunity. See Roommates, 521 F.3d

25

at 1168-69; Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, 339 F.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir. 2003).

Plaintiff also contends that Google provides in-person advice to some AdWords customers

2

“in order to provide tailored advice on how to best optimize AdWords, including proposing ad

3

budgets, selecting keywords and designing ad copy.” ¶ 20. Yet, nowhere does Plaintiff allege

4

that Google engaged in such in-person meetings to develop any misleading Mobile Subscription

5

Service Provider (“MSSP”) advertisements or to create any of the MSSP websites that allegedly

6

caused her injury. Plaintiff has not and cannot establish that Google acted as an information

7

content provider of any statements that provide the basis for her claims – claims that are legally

8

insufficient even if the CDA did not apply here – and her claims are barred by Section 230.

9

Accordingly, the Amended Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.

10

II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

11

A.

12

Plaintiff filed her original complaint on April 30, 2008, alleging she was injured when she

13

provided her cell phone number to “one or more” MSSPs who had advertised free ring tones, and

14

that those MSSPs thereafter placed charges on her cell phone bill for services she had expected

15

would be free. She sought to hold Google liable for her claimed injuries because (a) she had

16

found the MSSPs through a Google search; and (b) Google’s advertising policies should have

17

prevented the appearance of the MSSPs’ misleading ads on its search pages. See Docket No. 1 at

18

9-26.

19

ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AND MOTION TO DISMISS

Google moved to dismiss the Complaint on grounds, among others, that Section 230

20

immunizes internet service providers, including Google, from claims arising from content

21

provided by others. See Docket No. 43.

22

B.

23

On December 17, 2008, this Court granted Google’s motion to dismiss. Docket No. 48.

24

The Court found Plaintiff’s claims are “premised fundamentally on Google’s publication of the

25

AdWords advertisements,” but that Plaintiff had failed to allege facts to support the proposition

26

that Google was acting as an “internet content provider” or an “information content provider.”

27

Docket No. 48 at 13. The Court found that Plaintiff’s “bare allegation” that “Google assists its

28

customers in drafting AdWords and selecting keywords through both live support from its

AdWords Specialists and its advertising campaign optimization services” was “insufficient to

2

overcome the ‘robust’ protections of the CDA.” Id. In allowing Plaintiff another opportunity to

3

plead, the Court held Plaintiff must make “it ‘very clear that [Google] directly participates in

4

developing the alleged illegality.’” Id. at 6-7 n.3 (quoting Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1174)

5

(insertion in original).

6

C.

7

In response to the Order, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on January 16, 2009.

AMENDED COMPLAINT

8

Docket No. 49. As before, Plaintiff alleges that she received unauthorized charges on her cell

9

phone bill after she provided her cell phone number on “one or more” unidentified MSSP

10

websites.3 ¶ 47. Plaintiff claims she accessed these MSSP websites by clicking on Google

11

AdWords advertisements that appeared on the Google website after she entered terms like

12

“ringtone” into the Google search engine. ¶¶ 45-6. Although she does not identify the MSSPs or

13

the address of their websites, Plaintiff alleges that the websites did not display information

14

required by Google’s Advertising Program Terms and Content Policy. ¶ 47.

15

Plaintiff also continues to allege that MSSPs, billing aggregators, and cellular carriers

16

have engaged in a scheme by which they cause consumers “to be billed for services and products

17

irrespective of whether the consumer actually agreed to purchase them.” ¶ 10. According to

18

Plaintiff, these MSSPs collect consumer cell phone numbers, which they then provide to billing

19

aggregators. ¶ 11. These billing aggregators act as middlemen who instruct “the relevant cellular

20

carrier to add the charge to the bill associated with that cell phone number.” Id.

21

Plaintiff further alleges (as she did before) that “Google will participate in in-person

22

meetings . . . in order to provide tailored advice on how best to optimize their use of AdWords.”

23

¶ 20. She acknowledges that “keyword suggestions” are “utilized only at the discretion of the

24

advertiser” and that keyword ideas “will trigger the appearance of the relevant advertisement”

25

only “if selected by the advertiser.” ¶¶ 23, 25. Google’s Keyword Tool itself informs

26

advertisers: “You are responsible for the keywords you select and for ensuring that your use of

27

3

28

MSSPs provide products such as “customized ring tones for use with cell phones, sports score
reports, weather alerts, stock tips, horoscope services, and the like.” Id. ¶ 8.

the keywords does not violate any applicable laws.” Id. Ex A.

2

In response to the Order Dismissing the Complaint, however, plaintiff now alleges for the

3

first time that Google assists its customers in choosing keywords through its Keyword Tool,

4

which Plaintiff describes as a “suggestion tool” that uses an “algorithm” to “‘suggest’ specific

5

keywords to advertisers.” ¶ 22. From nothing more than these alleged facts, Plaintiff draws the

6

startling conclusion that “Google’s involvement [in the development of MSSPs’ advertisements]

7

was so pervasive that the company controlled much of the underlying commercial activity

8

engaged in by the third-party advertisers.” ¶ 21. Plaintiff continues:

9

Google creates algorithms, known as “suggestion tools,” for use by
advertisers and consumers alike. These algorithms control and determine
the results given to its advertisers and to consumers for any search
constructed through the use of Google’s search engine. Through the use
(and manipulation) of these algorithms, Google not only encourages illegal
conduct, it collaborates in the development of the illegal content and,
effectively, requires its advertiser customers to engage in it.

10
11
12
13

Id.

14

Though Plaintiff includes allegations that Google (a) controls the commercial activities of

15

its advertisers, and (b) requires its advertisers to engage in illegal conduct, none of the “facts”

16

alleged come close to supporting such claims. Plaintiff alleges that Google’s mathematical

17

algorithm “suggests” the use of the word “free” in relation to “ringtone,” as a means of attracting

18

more visitors to their sites, and that MSSPs whose offerings are not actually free are literally

19

powerless to resist the suggestion. ¶¶ 24-25.

20

Plaintiff does not allege, however, that Google assisted in creating either the AdWords

21

advertisements Plaintiff allegedly clicked on or the MSSP websites she visited, or that Google

22

required its advertisers either to adopt its suggestions or to include certain text in their

23

advertisements. And while Plaintiff alleges the “manipulation” of the algorithms (¶ 21), nowhere

24

does Plaintiff allege facts supporting that conclusion. Nor does Plaintiff allege that Google

25

compelled MSSPs to offer their services for free when those advertisers had no intention of

26

honoring such offers.

2

Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). To avoid dismissal,

“plaintiffs must plead facts showing they are entitled to relief.” Grosz v. Lassen Cmty. College

4

Dist., 572 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1207 n.11 (E.D. Cal. 2008). “[L]abels and conclusions, and a

5

formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,

6

550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). In deciding a motion to dismiss, “all allegations of material fact are

7

taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Cahill v. Liberty

8

Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996); however, “[f]actual allegations must be

9

enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the

10

complaint’s allegations are true.” Bell Atl., 550 U.S. at 555.

11

IV.

12

LEGAL ARGUMENT
Under Section 230, an interactive computer service is not liable for information a third

13

party posts to its website if: (1) it qualifies as a provider or user of an interactive computer service

14

under Section 230; (2) the plaintiff’s claims would hold the defendant liable as a publisher or

15

distributor of information created by another information content provider; and (3) the website is

16

not itself an information content provider of the content at issue. Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123.

17

The primary issue before the Court is whether Plaintiff has now alleged facts sufficient to

18

establish that Google is an information content provider under Section 230. Plaintiff’s Amended

19

Complaint demonstrates conclusively that she has not pled, and cannot plead, such facts; it should

20

be dismissed for failure to state a claim.

21

A.

22
23

PLAINTIFF HAS NOT ALLEGED ANY FACTS ESTABLISHING THAT GOOGLE
DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN DEVELOPING THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint – essentially a lengthy rehashing of the allegations in her

24

original complaint – does not allege facts that could establish that Google acted as an

25

“information content provider” under the Ninth Circuit’s narrow definition.4 Rather, Plaintiff’s

26

claims – that Google provides a “keyword tool” and “advice on how best to optimize their use of

27

4

3

As this Court already held in dismissing Plaintiff’s original complaint, the law is clear:

4

“providing third parties with neutral tools to create web content is considered to be squarely

5

within the protections of § 230,” regardless of whether “a service provider knows that third

6

parties are using such tools to create illegal content.” Docket No. 48 at 5 (noting that “[t]he broad

7

scope of § 230 extends to multiple forms of putative ‘involvement’ by an interactive service

8

provider in generating online content”).

9

As the Ninth Circuit held en banc in Roommates, an internet service does not become an

10

“information content provider” merely by “augmenting the content generally.” 521 F.3d at 1167-

11

68. Rather the service must “materially” contribute “to its alleged unlawfulness.” Id.; see also

12

Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123 (noting that courts treat “§ 230(c) immunity as quite robust, adopting

13

a . . . relatively restrictive definition of ‘information content provider’”). Consequently, websites

14

are not liable under Section 230 for basic editing functions, “[m]inor wording changes,” and

15

“neutral tools,” even if such actions facilitate the dissemination of unlawful content. Batzel v.

16

Smith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1022, 1031 (9th Cir. 2003) (listserv did not become an information content

“the FBI has been informed of the contents” of the post); see also Optinrealbig.com, LLC v.

Recognizing that “[w]ebsites are complicated enterprises, and there will always be close

TWO NINTH CIRCUIT CASES ESTABLISH THAT A WEBSITE DOES NOT LOSE ITS

13

The Ninth Circuit’s rulings in Carafano v. Metrosplash.com and Fair Housing Council v.

GOOGLE’S ALLEGED PROVISION OF NEUTRAL TOOLS CANNOT RENDER
GOOGLE AN INFORMATION CONTENT PROVIDER

18

An interactive computer service becomes an information content provider only by

19

“materially contributing to [the content’s] alleged unlawfulness.” Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1168.

20

Websites do not lose Section 230 immunity by offering neutral tools that merely facilitate the

21

development of content without contributing to the content’s underlying illegality. Carafano, 339

22

F.3d at 1125. Rather, a website’s involvement must be “direct and palpable,” for example, by

23

“removing the word ‘not’ from a user’s message reading ‘[Name] did not steal the artwork’ in

24

order to transform an innocent message into a libelous one.” Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1169.

25

Carafano concerned a false dating profile that an anonymous user posted to the

26

defendant’s matchmaking website by impersonating a famous television actress. Carafano, 339

27

F.3d at 1121. The profile appeared to have been posted by the actress and indicated that she

28

sought a sexual encounter and made allegedly offensive statements about her sexual preferences.

Id. To prepare the profile, the anonymous user employed tools the defendant website provided to

2

assist its users in creating online profiles. In particular, the website provided its users with “a

3

detailed questionnaire containing both multiple-choice and essay questions,” including “more

4

than fifty questions from menus providing between four and nineteen options. Some of the

5

potential multiple choice answers are innocuous; some are sexually suggestive.” Carafano, 339

6

F.3d at 1121. From this “menu of ‘pre-prepared responses,’” the anonymous user had selected

7

responses such as “‘Playboy/Playgirl’ for ‘main source of current events’ and ‘looking for a one-

8

night stand’ for ‘why did you call.” Id. at 1125. The website used these responses to create the

9

online profile. Id.

10

While acknowledging that these tools facilitated the development of the libelous profile,

11

sometimes providing even the actual language itself, the Ninth Circuit found the questionnaires

12

were merely “neutral tools” that were not sufficient to render the website an information content

13

provider under the CDA. Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1125; see also Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1171

14

(interpreting Carafano). The Ninth Circuit held that the website lacked responsibility for the

15

“underlying misinformation’” and therefore was not an information content provider under

16

Section 230. Id.

17

The Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Roommates further illuminates the scope of

18

Carafano’s “neutral tools” analysis, holding that a website loses its Section 230 immunity only

19

where it is “very clear that the website directly participates in developing the illegality” at issue.

20

Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1174. Although the Court warned that “there will always be close cases

21

where a clever lawyer could argue that something the website operator did encouraged the

22

illegality,” id. (emphasis in original), it found that “Roommate does much more than provide

23

options” or “encourage or solicit.” Id. at 1166 n.19. Instead, the website “makes answering the

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint does not allege any facts indicating that Google bears any

2.

GOOGLE IS NOT AN INFORMATION CONTENT PROVIDER

13

Just as it was the anonymous user who selected responses to the matchmaking website’s

14

questionnaire in Carafano, it is Google’s advertising customers who decide which, if any, of the

15

keywords generated by the Keyword Tool they should adopt; the “selection of content” from

16

these tools is “left exclusively to the user.” Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1124. Plaintiff admits that

17

keywords “are typically utilized only at the discretion of the advertiser” and will only be included

18

“if selected by the advertiser.” ¶¶ 21-22, 25. In fact, Google’s Keyword Tool clearly informs

19

advertisers, “You are responsible for the keywords you select and for ensuring that your use of

20

the keywords does not violate any applicable laws.” Id. Ex. A. In the same vein, Plaintiff does

21

not allege that live Google representatives so much as suggested misleading or unlawful content

22

to its customers or encouraged any customer to adopt any such content.

23

Plaintiff nevertheless claims that Google was an information content provider because

24

Google’s algorithms “encourage” its MSSP advertisers to use the word “free” when drafting

25

AdWords advertisements, even if the services the MSSPs offer are not free. In particular,

26

Plaintiff alleges that when a potential advertiser or a Google user enters “ringtone” into Google’s

27

answer if they want to use defendant’s services.” Id. at 1166. The website then displayed this
information on the user’s profile page and used the information to actively match users with
compatible responses. Id.

because their advertisements allegedly would not appear if Google users did not search for the

7

At its core, Plaintiff’s allegations amount to a claim that because Google provides data to

8

its advertisers showing alternate keyword options, Google “effectively requires advertisers to

10

not comparable with the website’s conduct in Roommates. Nowhere does Plaintiff allege that

11

Google requires its customers to adopt its keyword suggestions as a “condition of doing business”

13

Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1166. Plaintiff admits that the ultimate selection of keywords is “only at

14

the discretion of the advertiser,” ¶¶ 25; Google, at most, provides “a framework that could be

15

utilized for proper or improper purposes,” Roommates, 521 F.3d at 1172. Google is no more

16

responsible for the selection of false content by advertisers than the matchmaking website was

17

responsible for the selection of false multiple-choice answers in Carafano. As this Court held in

18

dismissing Plaintiff’s original Complaint, the Ninth Circuit “emphasized repeatedly that the

19

Roommates website lost immunity only by forcing its users to provide the allegedly

20

discriminatory information as a condition of access.” Docket No. 48 at 5 (emphasis in original).

21

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint again fails to allege any facts establishing that Google “forced”

Filed02/05/09 Page17 of 25

PLAINTIFF FAILS TO PLEAD A VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS &

Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim alleges, improbably, that Google engaged in “money

4
5

laundering” as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) by knowingly accepting funds derived from a

6

“specified unlawful act.” Plaintiff claims the funds the MSSPs paid to Google for its advertising

7

services were derived from violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), allegedly

8

a “specified unlawful act” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a). Because Plaintiff’s allegations do

9

not, and cannot, state a claim that the MSSPs violated the CFAA as an initial matter and because,

10

in any event, Google could not have had the requisite knowledge under 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) that

11

such funds were derived from an allegedly unlawful activity, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim

THE MSSPS DID NOT VIOLATE THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND
ABUSE ACT

To establish that the MSSP revenue paid to Google for advertising services was derived

15
16

from a “specified unlawful act” for purposes of Section 1957, Plaintiff alleges the MSSPs

17

violated 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) or 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) of the CFAA by charging her for

18

mobile content to which she did not subscribe.8 ¶ 64. The MSSPs’ charges, no matter how

19

fraudulent they are alleged to be, are not within the scope of the CFAA, and Plaintiff’s allegations

are insufficient to state a claim that the MSSPs violated the CFAA as a matter of law.

While Plaintiff has added new allegations to her Amended Complaint in a misguided attempt to
plead around Section 230, she made no material changes to her substantive claims or to the
theories underlying those claims. Accordingly, Google respectfully repeats here the arguments
set forth in its original motion to dismiss as to why those claims should be dismissed independent
of whether Section 230 immunity applies. Google does not believe it is necessary for the Court to
reach these arguments, if, as discussed above, Section 230 immunizes Google from Plaintiff’s
claims.
8

The fraud Plaintiff alleges is the “intent to defraud [subscribers] out of the services’
unauthorized charges.” ¶ 61. Similarly, the alleged “damage” is based on the allegation that “[i]f
the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services’ unauthorized charges are not paid eventually, the
cellular carriers will discontinue all services (including cellular service)” and therefore “impair
the availability of Class members’ access to and communication with their cellular service.” ¶

Congress enacted the CFAA to punish destructive computer hacking and theft of

narrow view of the CFAA.” Shamrock Foods Co., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 966. Because the goal of

7

the CFAA is to punish hackers and trespassers who cause injury to others by infiltrating their

8

computers, the CFAA requires both a trespass of a computer and loss, damage, or fraud resulting

9

from the unauthorized access. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rickman, 554 F. Supp. 2d 766,

10

770 (N. D. Ohio 2008). The two provisions of the CFAA upon which Plaintiff relies, Section

11

1030(a)(4) and Section 1030(a)(5)(B), both expressly apply only where the defendant has (1)

12

accessed a protected computer without authorization, and (2) perpetrated a fraud or caused

13

damage by means of that access.9

14

The scheme of the CFAA is clear: it is not enough to merely access computers; the

15

defendant must actively cause harm and obtain something of value by way of the access. United

States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1078 (1st Cir. 1997) (reversing conviction under CFAA

17

because, although defendant’s use of IRS computer to browse confidential taxpayer information

‘anything of value’”). The damage must be actually related to “the context of computer hacking.”

1030(a)(4) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 1030(a)(5)(B) only applies if a person
“intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such
conduct, recklessly causes damage.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) (emphasis added). “Damage” is
defined as “any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or
information, that (A) causes loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value during any 1-year period to
one or more individuals.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8). These claims are not satisfied in the absence
of loss or damage resulting directly from the unlawful access.

GOOGLE DID NOT KNOWINGLY ENGAGE IN A MONETARY
TRANSACTION INVOLVING CRIMINALLY DERIVED PROPERTY

Even assuming arguendo that the MSSPs did violate the CFAA, Plaintiff’s Section 17200

11

claim cannot succeed unless Google itself performed an unlawful act. Although Plaintiff claims

12

Google engaged in “money laundering” as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a), there is no set of

13

facts by which Google could have violated § 1957(a).

14

Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) requires actual knowledge “that a transaction involved

15

criminal property” and that “the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity.” United

16

States v. Yagman, 502 F. Supp. 2d 1084 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Recognizing the possibility for abuse

17

of Section 1957, the Ninth Circuit construes the statute narrowly, holding that “Section 1957 was

18

enacted as a tool in the war against drugs” and “[s]uch a powerful instrument of criminal justice

19

should not be expanded by judicial invention or ingenuity.” United States v. Rutgard, 116 F.3d

20

1270, 1292 (9th Cir. 1997).

21

To violate Section 1957, the transferred funds must be traceable directly to the underlying

22

crime. Rutgard, 116 F.3d at 1292-93 (overturning Section 1957 conviction on grounds that

23

defendant’s bank account contained some lawfully obtained money as well as criminally derived

money and the government failed to trace the withdrawal to the unlawful funds); Yagman, 502 F.

25

Supp. 2d at 1087-1093 (overturning convictions for failure to adequately trace funds in

either the lawful or unlawfully obtained monies. Rutgard, 116 F.3d at 1292-93. Moreover, the

provisions, these Advertising Terms require customers to abide by Google’s policies (including

¶¶ 31-32 and Ex. F. Plaintiff claims that by failing to disallow advertisements that did not include

Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim suffers from additional fatal flaws. Plaintiff cannot establish

exclusive monetary remedy available to private plaintiffs under Section 17200 and “is limited to
the return of property or funds in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest (or is claiming
through someone with an ownership interest).” Madrid v. Perot Sys. Corp., 130 Cal. App. 4th
440, 453 (2005). Because Plaintiff alleges that she paid the MSSPs, not Google, and because she
does not contend that she had any ownership interest in funds paid to Google, she cannot establish
any entitlement to restitution from Google. See id. Plaintiff’s inability to assert restitution as a
remedy against Google and her failure to allege that Google caused any injury deprives her of
standing to assert a Section 17200 claim against Google is an independent basis upon which to
dismiss this action. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204 (a private person has standing to assert a
Section 17200 claim only if he or she (1) “has suffered injury in fact,” and (2) “has lost money or

GOOGLE MADE NO PROMISE TO ENFORCE ITS ADVERTISING
TERMS

As an initial matter, Google cannot be liable for a promise it did not make. See Souza,
135 Cal. App. 4th at 892 (“If a contract is to be a basis of liability for the [defendant’s] violation
of [its Terms and Conditions] . . . it must be a contract in which the [defendant] promises to abide
by [these terms].”). Google’s Advertising Terms were a promise by Google’s advertising
customers to Google in exchange for participation in Google’s advertising service. Plaintiff has
not alleged and cannot point to any provision in Google’s Advertising Terms by which Google
promised to enforce the Advertising Terms or otherwise remove noncompliant advertisements.
In dismissing allegations virtually indistinguishable from Plaintiff’s, the California Court
of Appeal recognized the absurdity of holding a service provider liable to an unrelated third party
for failure to enforce its own terms and conditions. See Souza, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 893-94.
There is no basis for inferring (and Plaintiff does not allege) that Google made a promise to its
advertising customers that it would enforce the Advertising Terms against them; any such
promise would have been made to Google’s advertisers and would have been to their detriment.
See id. at 892. Google’s Advertising Terms commit only its AdWords customers to comply with
those terms; they do not confer any rights upon Plaintiff. See also Green v. America Online, 318
F.3d 465, 472 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding “that Green failed to state a claim for breach of contract
because . . . by their terms, the Member Agreement and Community Guidelines were not intended
to confer any rights on Green and AOL did not promise to protect Green from the acts of other
subscribers”). Because Google made no promise to enforce its Advertising Terms, Plaintiff’s
claims against Google for its failure to enforce its those terms must be dismissed.

Plaintiff does not allege that she was a party to the Advertising Terms and therefore cannot

PLAINTIFF IS NOT AN INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF
THE ADVERTISING TERMS

In any event, as a non-party to the Advertising Terms, Plaintiff may assert a claim for

4

breach of contract only if she is an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement. Souza, 135

5

Cal. App. 4th 879; Martinez v. Socoma Cos., 11 Cal. 3d 394, 406 (1974). Whether a party is a

6

third party beneficiary may be determined as a matter of law. Souza, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 891.

7

For Plaintiff to qualify as an intended third party beneficiary of the Advertising Terms,

8

those terms would have to reflect, on their face, an intent to benefit Plaintiff. Martinez, 11 Cal.

9

3d at 406. “To attain standing as a third party beneficiary of a contract, a person must show

10

clearly that when the parties executed their agreement they intended its execution to confer real

11

benefits on that person.” Highfields Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Doe, 385 F. Supp. 2d 969, 980 (N.D.

12

Cal. 2005) (internet users are not third party beneficiaries of Yahoo! Service agreement because

13

there “is nothing in the language of the contract that even remotely suggests such intention”)

14

(emphasis original). Plaintiff has not alleged the Advertising Terms reflect any intent to benefit

15

her and, in fact, expressly alleges the terms were intended to benefit Google. ¶ 40-42.

16

More significantly, a third party is not an intended beneficiary of an agreement unless the

17

promisee intends the agreement to benefit the third party. Id. at 893. (“The point of the third-

18

party beneficiary doctrine is to allow a third party to enforce, against a promisor, rights running to

19

the third party for which the promisee bargained.”). The intent of the promisor “is not at issue.”

20

Id. Assuming arguendo that Google did in fact promise to enforce its Advertising Terms, Google

21

would be the promisor of the agreement and the allegedly fraudulent MSSP would be the

22

promisee. Consequently, for Plaintiff to be an intended third party beneficiary, the Advertising

23

Terms would have to reflect an intent by the allegedly fraudulent MSSP to benefit Plaintiff. The

24

Souza court found such a result to be absurd, and held as a matter of law that the plaintiff in that

25

case was not an intended beneficiary. Id. at 893. There is no basis for a different conclusion

26

here; accordingly, Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim must be dismissed.

PLAINTIFF’S NEGLIGENCE CLAIM IS BARRED AS A MATTER OF LAW

1

advertisements, have no independent duty to police content for accuracy. See, e.g., Walters v.

2

Seventeen Magazine, 195 Cal. App. 3d 1119, 1122 (1987) (magazine could not be held liable for

3

teen’s injury from a product advertised in the magazine); see also McCulloch v. Ford Dealers

4

Adver. Ass’n, 234 Cal. App. 3d 1385 (1991) (corporation had no duty to participants in fraudulent

5

contest despite having affixed its logo to the materials promoting the contest). Accordingly,

6

absent a showing of some special duty, Plaintiff may not assert a claim of negligence against

7

Google.

8
9

Plaintiff alleges that Google’s Advertising Terms represent a voluntary assumption of a
duty of care to Google’s users. ¶ 78. Plaintiff claims Google’s Content Policy required its MSSP

10

advertisers to “prominently display” certain information on their websites, including

11

identification of the service as a subscription, price of the service, billing interval, and

12

cancellation information. ¶ 32. Plaintiff alleges “these statements in its Content Policy amount to

13

public representations by Google of the accuracy and clarity of pricing, subscription, and

14

cancellation information that Google users can expect to find on third-party websites linked to

15

AdWords advertisements . . . .” ¶ 33.

16

Under California law, however, Google cannot be found to have assumed a duty to

17

Plaintiff unless (1) the Advertising Terms themselves increased the risk of harm or (2) Plaintiff

18

actually relied upon the Advertising Terms. Paz v. State of California, 22 Cal. 4th 550, 560

19

(2000). “A defendant’s undertaking of protective services increases the risk of harm if, as a result

20

of his actions, the risk of harm is greater than if he had done nothing at all.” McIntosh v. U.S.,

21

Civ. No. 05-373 (BTM), 2008 WL 4492592, *8 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2008).

22

Plaintiff has not alleged that she relied on—or even read—Google’s Advertising Terms

23

and Content Policy. In any event, it would be absurd to suggest that she relied on the Content

24

Policy to her detriment: had Plaintiff read Google’s Content Policy, the conspicuous absence of

25

the required information about pricing, subscription, and cancellation on the MSSP website

26

would have alerted her to the fact that the website was out of compliance with the Content Policy.

27
28

Plaintiff also fails to allege that the Advertising Terms increased her risk of injury. Had
Google “done nothing at all,” the allegedly misleading MSSP websites would have been equally,

if not more, misleading. Plaintiff’s risk of harm from the MSSP advertisements was therefore the

2

same, if not less, than it would have been in the absence of Google’s Advertising Terms and

3

Content Policy.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR AIDING AND ABETTING VARIOUS VIOLATIONS
ALSO FAILS

To state a claim for aiding and abetting, Plaintiff must allege that the aider and abetter (1)

7

“knows that the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty,” and (2) “gives substantial

8

assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.” Orser v. George, 252 Cal. App.

9

2d 660, 666 (1967). Courts emphasize that the substantial assistance requirement is necessary to

10

protect defendants with only a “slight” or tenuous relationship to the alleged wrongdoing. Id. at

11

669. To ascertain whether a defendant has provided substantial assistance, courts look at “the

12

nature of the act encouraged, the amount of assistance given by the defendant, his presence or

13

absence at the time of the tort, his relation to the other and his state of mind.” Id.

14

Plaintiff alleges that, by simply allowing MSSPs to advertise on its website, Google aided

15

and abetted the MSSP violation of Section 17200, violation of the CFAA, and trespass to chattels.

16

¶¶ 84-87. Plaintiff has failed, as an initial matter, to allege that Google provided “substantial

17

assistance,” as required to state a claim for aiding and abetting. Moreover, Plaintiff’s sole

18

allegation against Google is that Google provided the MSSPs the opportunity to advertise. Such a

19

tenuous relationship with the alleged wrongdoing cannot amount to the substantial assistance

20

required to hold Google liable for the MSSP’s activities. Id. at 669 (“The assistance of or

21

participation by the defendant may be so slight that he is not liable for the act of the other.”).12

22

V.

23

CONCLUSION
This Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend to allege facts sufficient to establish that

24

Google was an information content provider under Section 230, but Plaintiff’s Amended

25

12

26
27
28

In any event, as discussed previously, the MSSPs have not violated the CFAA as a matter of
law. See Section IV.C.1.a. Even if the transmission of content to the Plaintiff’s cell phone could
constitute trespass of a chattel, the harm Plaintiff alleges—charges for mobile content services
she did not subscribe to—are unrelated to any “trespass” of her cell phone, and the relationship
between the MSSP advertisements and the MSSP’s “trespass” is so tenuous as to be
unforeseeable. See Orser, 252 Cal. App. 2d at 669.

1

Complaint has failed to allege facts that “make it very clear that the website [Google] directly

2

participates in developing the illegality’ at issue.” Docket 48 at 6 (citations omitted). Instead,

3

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint sets forth a series of factually unsupported conclusions alleging

4

that Google controlled its AdWords customers’ fraudulent advertisements and rendered them

5

powerless to resist the temptation to list mobile content as “free” when it was not. Because the

6

facts alleged do not support these facially outlandish conclusions, the Amended Complaint does

7

not accomplish the objective Plaintiff was assigned. Plaintiff has not alleged what the Ninth

8

Circuit says it must to avoid application of the CDA, Google is not an information content

9

provider; it is merely the publisher, and the CDA immunizes it from liability for the purportedly

10

false statements of MSSPs. Google respectfully asks this Court to dismiss the Amended

11

Complaint without leave to amend on this basis. In the alternative, Google respectfully asks this

12

Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint without leave to amend on the grounds that, even

13

absent Section 230 immunity, she has failed to state a claim.
