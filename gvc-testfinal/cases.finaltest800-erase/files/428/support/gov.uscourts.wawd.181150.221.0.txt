The Court should reconsider its Order denying defendants’ motions to suppress because
intervening United States Supreme Court authority makes the Order’s curtilage rulings untenable.

Florida v. Jardines, 509 U.S. ___ (3/26/2013) finds that the Fourth Amendment does not allow the

19

police to approach homes in the middle of the night to search for evidence without a warrant, even if

20

the police walk up a sidewalk or driveway.

police intrusion that the Order approves and vitiates the analysis on which the Order depends.

Jardines is binding precedent that condemns the kind of

Reconsideration is therefore necessary.

I.

The Illegal Searches
The police repeatedly made warrantless entries onto private property in the middle of the

26

night for the purpose of obtaining evidence. The officers surreptitiously approached as close as

27

possible to the homes they were investigating without making any effort to contact the occupants.

Hearing Transcript at 268-270. The search warrant affidavit itself and the testimony from the police

2

at the evidentiary hearing reveal that the police engaged in such conduct on dozens of occasions.

3

Exhibit 1 lists 66 places in the affidavit describing instances where the police went onto private

4

property and obtained evidence. This evidence, which includes many instances of smelling
5

marijuana and/or hearing fans, is central to the affidavit’s showing of probable cause.
II. The Government’s Defense of the Police Conduct and the Court’s Order
In response to defendants’ assertions in the motions to suppress that the police intrusions
violated the Fourth Amendment, the government claimed that the police could engage in late night

10

surreptitious intrusions so long as they stayed on driveways and walkways. See, e.g. Response to
11
12

Post Evidentiary Motions at 9-10 and cases cited therein, docket #172. This Court’s Order denying

13

the motions to suppress impliedly accepts the government’s position and finds only two curtilage

14

violations. As to the two violations (both of which involve the police venturing off the driveway or

15

walkway) that the Court found, it ruled that exclusion of evidence was not the “proper remedy”.

III. Florida v. Jardines
Florida v. Jardines, 509 U.S.__ (3/26/2013) rejects the government’s arguments and the

20

Court’s conclusions. The decision explicitly addresses and condemns police approaching homes at

21

night and it affirms that the appropriate remedy for police intrusions onto private property is

22

suppression of the evidence.

23
24

In Jardines, a police officer accompanied by a “drug dog” went to a home to investigate a tip

25

that the owners were growing marijuana. After observing the home from the street, the officer went

26

onto the home’s property and approached the home by the front path. When the dog got near the

front porch it alerted and then, after sniffing at the base of the front door, it sat down, indicating that

2

it sensed drugs within the home.

3

Jardines upholds the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling that this police activity violated the

4

Fourth Amendment and affirms the remedy of suppression. The Jardines Court does not accept the
5
6

argument that, because a driveway or a walkway is open to the public for the purpose of going to the

7

home and contacting the occupants, that this means the police can intrude on private property and

8

approach a home to investigate and obtain evidence. In other words, and crucial to the case here, it is

9

not just where the police are when they conduct the search but why they are there. “The scope of a

10

license, express or implied—is limited not only to a particular area but to a specific purpose.”

11
12

16

Jardines at 7.
Even more critical to the outcome here, Jardines finds nighttime intrusions to be
impermissible. Indeed, every member of the Court, both those in the majority and those in the
dissent, agrees that the police violate the Fourth Amendment when they go onto private property in
the middle of the night to search for evidence. The majority opinion states that “We think a typical

17
18

person would find it a cause for “great alarm” (the kind of reaction the dissent quite rightly relies

19

upon to justify its no-night-visits rule), post at 5 to find a stranger snooping about his front

20

porch…”. Jardines at 7, ftn 3 (emphasis added). The dissent, for its part, says that “Nor, as a

21
22

general matter, may a visitor come to the front door in the middle of the night without an
express invitation. See State v. Cada [citation omitted], ‘Furtive intrusion late at night or in the

23
24

predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors. Indeed, if observed by a

25

resident of the premises, it could be a cause for great alarm.” Dissent at 5 (emphasis added). Here,

26

no question exists that the vast majority of the police trespasses occurred late at night. Hearing

The intrusions onto private property and the fourth amendment violations are forbidden
whether or not a dog accompanies the police officer. “We think a typical person would find it a
cause “for great alarm” … to find a stranger snooping about his front porch with or without a dog.”

Jardines also makes clear that the exclusionary rule applies when the police obtain evidence

7

in violation of the fourth amendment by going onto private property, even if the intrusion is relatively

8

brief or minor. The Jardines court, although considering an intrusion for only a few minutes in the

9

middle of the day, does not engage in any balancing test about whether the costs of suppression

10

outweigh the benefits of applying the exclusionary rule. Instead, it affirms the order of the Florida
11
12
13
14
15

courts that the evidence be suppressed.
IV. The Affidavit at Issue Here Involves Exactly the Conduct That Jardines Condemns
This case involves dozens of curtilage violations of exactly the type unanimously condemned
by Jardines. Detective Brockus admitted at the suppression hearing that he and his fellow officers

16

repeatedly went on to private property and approached homes in the middle of the night, getting as
17
18

close as possible to the homes, in order to obtain evidence and without making any effort to contact

19

the occupants. See Hearing Transcript 268-272. The affidavit itself explicitly admits to this

20

conduct. See Exhibit 1, noting where such admissions occur.

21
22

V. All of the Illegally Obtained Evidence Must Be Excised from the Affidavit
United States v. Vasey, 834 F.2d 782 (9th Cir. 1987), and its progeny hold that when a

23
24

search warrant affidavit includes evidence gathered in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the

25

reviewing court must excise all of the evidence so obtained and only then decide whether the

26

remaining untainted evidence suffices for probable cause.

The redactions Vasey requires are fatal to the affidavit’s showing of probable cause. The
search affidavit includes at least 66 instances describing the police obtaining evidence while on
private property in the middle of the night without a warrant. Exhibit 1, attached. In at least 43

4

instances, the affidavit discusses the detection of the odor of marijuana while the police were
5
6
7
8
9

committing a Fourth Amendment violation. Exhibit 1.
The illegally obtained evidence forms the core of the affidavit. The affidavit depends on the odors
of marijuana detected during the illegal searches and the sounds of fans heard and other observations
during the illegal searches to establish probable cause. Once the evidence illegally obtained is

10

removed from the affidavit, little remains. The affidavit does not include any evidence of any
11
12

marijuana actually seen in any of the homes to be searched or even any statements from any person

13

that the homes contain marijuana. The affidavit’s efforts to paint a vast conspiracy to grow marijuana

14

based on such matters as changes in utility subscriptions or observations of parked cars come to

15

naught once the illegally obtained evidence that marijuana is being grown at the houses to be

16

searched is excised.

VII.

The Motion to Suppress Evidence Regarding 2402 NE 91st Must Be Reconsidered

The Court should reconsider its ruling for 2402 NE 91st St. [the home of Ngheim Nguyen] for
two reasons.
The Court’s Order does not address any of Ms. Ngheim’s individual claims. However, the
government concedes that the observations Detective Brockus included in the affidavit about his visit

23
24

to Ms. Ngheim’s home on August 26, 2010 never occurred and should not be included in any

25

probable cause determination. (See Govt’s post-evidentiary brief at 10, docket #172.) In its Order

26

the Court found “no factual support” for the argument that the affidavit contains false information

1

(Order at 5) without acknowledging the undisputed fact that the affidavit contains false information

2

about Ms. Nguyen’s home and without considering the impact of the false information.

3
4

Absent the false information about the August 26, 2010 visit, the only incriminating
observation about 2402 NE 91st found in the affidavit is that on October 5, 2010, the police heard the

5
6

sound of fans coming from the home while standing in the driveway. Aff. at 191. At the hearing,

7

Detective Brockus admitted standing as close as possible to the garage (which is attached to the

8

home), to not making any effort to contact the occupants, and to being there only for the purpose of

9

gathering evidence. Hearing Transcript at 269-274. Jardines compels the conclusion that the police

10

activity on October 5, 2010 violated the Fourth Amendment and that the evidence obtained must be
11
12
13
14
15

removed from the affidavit.
At no time during any of their many visits to 2402 NE 91st did the police ever detect the odor
of marijuana and at no time did they ever observe any suspicious activity at the home.
Without any incriminating observations of the home, the “probable cause” that the home

16

was being used to grow marijuana boils down to conclusory statements about one month of power
17
18

records from July of 2011, 15 months before the search and observations of some cars allegedly

19

belonging to other people who might be growing marijuana parked near the house. (At no time did

20

the police ever observe any person doing anything at the home that would in any way indicate the

21

growing of marijuana. Cf.United States v. Huguez-Ibarra, 954 F.2d 546 (9th Cir. 1992) finding no

22

probable cause even when the police saw cars associated with drug dealers at a house and witnessed

23
24
25

suspicious actions by such persons.) Good faith cannot rescue the search of Ms. Nguyen’s home in
the face of such meager evidence.

The Court should grant the motion to reconsider, follow the precedent of Florida v. Jardines,
and grant the motions to suppress evidence because of the undisputed and pervasive Fourth
Amendment violations used in the affidavit to establish probable cause.
