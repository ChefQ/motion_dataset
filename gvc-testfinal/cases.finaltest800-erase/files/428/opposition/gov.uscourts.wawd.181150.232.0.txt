I. Florida v. Jardines Describes and Condemns the Police Conduct at Issue Here
The evidence is not in dispute. The garage at 2402 NE 91st St. is attached to the house and

20
21

the garage has a living area above it. When Officer Brockus made the only observation of 2402 NE

22

91st that provides evidence of a marijuana grow, he was standing immediately next to the attached

23

garage in the middle of the night. Hearing Transcript 274; 279. Detective Brockus was standing

24

immediately next to an attached garage with living quarters above it in the middle of the night

25

because he was seeking to obtain evidence about what was inside the home and attached garage.

26
27
28

When he went on Ms. Nghiem’s property and walked up to just in front of the attached garage, he
made no effort to contact the occupants. Hearing Transcript 269-270.

The Fourth Amendment protects against exactly the activity engaged in by the police here.
The Government’s Response refuses to acknowledge that this is the clear message delivered by
Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. _ (2013). Just as in Jardines, the police were “gathering information in

4

an area belonging to [the home owner or occupant] and immediately surrounding his house—in the
5
6

curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys protection as part of the home itself.” Jardines at

7

3, emphasis supplied. Just as in Jardines, the police were not on the property for the purpose of

8

contacting the occupants. Further, the intrusion here was in the middle of the night. As defendant

9

has already noted, every single member of the Jardines Court, both in the majority and the dissent,

10

agrees that the Fourth Amendment prohibits warrantless intrusions onto private property by the police
11
12

in the middle of the night. Jardines at 7, ftn. 3 and Dissent at 5.

13

Confronted with overwhelming evidence that the police in this case violated the Fourth

14

Amendment, the government takes the tack of ignoring the Supreme Court. “Florida v. Jardines has

15

no bearing on the case” the government assures this Court. Response at 1. According to the

16

government, no constitutional impediment prevents the police from sneaking up to a house in the
17
18

middle of the night without a warrant for the purpose of gathering evidence. To support this

19

remarkable proposition, the government alludes to the curtilage factors set forth in United States v.

20

Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987). Response at 3-4. The government misreads and misapplies Dunn.

21
22

Jardines itself shows the error of the government’s approach. The Jardines court observes
that the “very core” of the Fourth Amendment is protection of the home and that “This right would be

23
24

of little practical value if the State’s agents could stand in a home’s porch or side garden and trawl for

25

evidence with impunity; the right to retreat would be significantly diminished if the police could enter

26

a man’s property to observe his repose from just outside the front window.” Jardines at 4. Nowhere

27

does Jardines or, for that matter, Dunn suggest that a homeowner must erect barricades or no-

1

trespassing signs or else consent to the police venturing onto his property without a warrant and

2

peering into his home or listening at his door in the middle of the night. Instead, Jardines emphasizes

3
4

that the area right next to one’s home is part of the curtilage and that this is “easily understood from
our everyday experience.” Jardines at 5, quoting Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 182, n. 12

5
6

(1984).

7

Curtilage issues can sometimes be difficult to decide. For example, if Ms. Nguyen had had a

8

300 foot long driveway and the police trespassed one foot onto in the middle of the day, there might

9

be some question as to whether the Fourth Amendment had been violated and the Dunn factors might

10

be of some assistance. Here, however, because the police made the observation in question from a
11
12
13
14
15

vantage point immediately adjacent to the home when their only purpose was to gather evidence, the
Fourth Amendment violation is plain.
II. Davis v. United States Does Not Apply to this Case
The government’s second line of defense is that, even if the police did violate the Fourth

16

Amendment, Davis v. United States, 131 S.Ct. 2419 (2011) precludes application of the exclusionary
17
18

rule. Response at 8. Again, the government misreads the case it cites. Davis holds that the

19

exclusionary rule does not apply when (1) the Supreme Court issues a new Fourth Amendment rule

20

that overturns “binding precedent” and (2) the police activity complained of occurred prior to the

21

announcement of the new rule and was in accordance with the “binding precedent” then in effect.

22

Neither of these circumstances is present here.

23
24

Jardines is not like Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009), the decision whose impact Davis

25

addresses. Gant overruled the long-established rule set forth in Belton v. New York, 453 U.S. 454

26

(1981). Jardines, in contrast, does not in any way overturn any Fourth Amendment rule, but simply

27

applies well-established law to a particular set of circumstances.

Also unlike the situation in Davis, the police here did not act pursuant to any Ninth Circuit
“binding precedent” approving the conduct at issue. The only cases to which the government can cite
as supposed “binding precedent” involve the police venturing onto a driveway to affix a tracking
device to a car. See Response at 9, citing United States v. Pineda Moreno, 591 F.3d 1212 (9th Cir.

5
6

2010) and United States v. McIver, 186 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 1999). The government does not mention

7

that in Pineda Moreno the government conceded that the police had violated the curtilage when

8

affixing the tracking devices in the driveway or that in McIver the defendant did not contest that the

9

police were outside the curtilage when putting the tracking devices on the car. In any event, neither

10

the decisions cited by the government nor any other Ninth Circuit precedent condone the police,
11
12
13
14
15
16

without a warrant, sneaking right up next to a house to try to find out what is going on inside the
house.
III. The Good Faith Exception Does Not Apply
The Government’s final effort to salvage the search is to claim that “good faith” still applies.
Govt’s Response at 8-9. In making this argument, the government ignores United States v. Vasey,

17
18

834 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1987), which holds that if a warrant affidavit contains evidence resulting from

19

an illegal police search, the reviewing court must excise all such information from the affidavit and

20

only then analyze the redacted warrant to determine if it sets forth probable cause. Vasey further

21

holds that the good faith doctrine does not apply if the affidavit includes evidence obtained by the

22

police in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

23
24

The government’s response does not deal with Vasey’s binding precedent. Further, the

25

government does not even attempt to perform the redactions commanded by Vasey or to demonstrate

26

that a properly redacted affidavit states probable cause for the search of Ms. Nguyen’s home.

27

Instead, the government restricts itself to generalized observations about the affidavit’s contents.

1

Response at 7. This retreat to generalities (most of which do not even apply to Ms. Nguyen’s home)

2

constitutes a tacit admission that the government cannot demonstrate probable cause for the search of

3

the particular home in question.

4

CONCLUSION
5

The bottom line is that Detective Brockus violated the Fourth Amendment. The evidence he

6
7

obtained from his illegal actions underlies the probable cause for the affidavit as a whole and for Ms.

8

Nguyen’s home in particular. Florida v. Jardines is important, not because it makes new Fourth

9
10

Amendment law, but because it reaffirms long-established and core Fourth Amendment principles
and because it addresses and condemns the same kind of activity that is at issue in this case.1

11

The Court should reconsider its decision and grant the motion to suppress the evidence taken

12
13

from Ngheim Nguyen’s home.

Even if some of Jardine’s observations on which defendant relies can be characterized as dicta, they must still be treated
with “due deference”. United States v. Baird, 85 F.3d 450, 453 (9th Cir. 1996).
