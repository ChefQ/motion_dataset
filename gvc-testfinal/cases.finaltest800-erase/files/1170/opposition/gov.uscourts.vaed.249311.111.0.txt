Civil Action No. 3:09-CV-00791 REP

SUNBEAM’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
HOMELAND HOUSEWARES, LLC’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY
SUNBEAM’S COUNSEL
At the May 17, 2010 Markman hearing, Homeland argued vigorously that its ‘640, ‘362
and ‘944 patents were not relevant to Sunbeam’s patent claims. Indeed, Homeland’s counsel
argued that it was “totally inappropriate” for the Court to consider those patents in determining
the meaning of the term “cap.” Subsequently, however, Homeland had an epiphany, and the
once irrelevant patents became the basis for Homeland’s motion to disqualify Sunbeam’s
counsel, Steptoe & Johnson.
Disqualification is warranted, Homeland argues, because Andrew Chen, an attorney now
employed by Steptoe, drafted the’640 and ‘750 patent applications when he was employed by
Homeland’s counsel in 2003-04. While conceding that the ‘640 and’750 patent applications are
public records, Homeland nevertheless asserts a conflict on the grounds that Mr. Chen

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 2 of 17

purportedly acquired confidences – Homeland’s reasoning behind the terminology used in its
patents – in the course of preparing those applications, and in the course of drafting a complaint
in an infringement action for another patent. This information is relevant, so the theory goes,
because Sunbeam asserts that Homeland’s ‘640, ‘362 and ‘944 patents support Sunbeam’s claim
construction.
Homeland’s motion does not come remotely close to satisfying the high standard of proof
that Homeland must meet to disqualify Sunbeam’s counsel. Rather, it was filed for an improper
tactical purpose of delay. Homeland’s patents are wholly irrelevant to this action. Indeed, even
Homeland has argued that they are “totally inappropriate” for the Court to consider. This case
does not involve, let alone revolve around, the content or the interpretation of Homeland’s
patents or any information that Mr. Chen might possess.

Instead, the issue is whether

Homeland’s products infringe Sunbeam’s patents. As a result, Mr. Chen’s patent application
work for Homeland and Sunbeam’s patent infringement action are not substantially related. The
Court should summarily deny Homeland’s motion.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Mr. Chen’s Work for Homeland
Contrary to Homeland’s assertions, at no time did Mr. Chen develop a strong familiarity
with Homeland’s products, their components, Homeland’s patent prosecution strategies,
litigation strategies or settlement strategies. See Declaration of Andrew Chen (Ex. 1).
Mr. Chen worked with numerous clients at Cislo, including Homeland. The only work
that Mr. Chen recalls that he did for Homeland pertained to the Magic Bullet® device. Mr. Chen
never spoke with anyone at Homeland regarding the inventions disclosed in the patent
applications that led to U.S. Patent Nos. 6,817,750 (“the ‘750 patent”) and 7,066,640 (“the ‘640

-2-

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

patent”). Mr. Cislo provided Mr. Chen with any invention disclosure or information that was
used to draft the applications. Mr. Chen has no recollection of ever receiving any information
regarding Homeland’s reasoning behind the terminology used in its patents, and he currently has
no knowledge of any such reasoning. While Mr. Chen drafted the patent applications, Mr. Cislo
was ultimately responsible for reviewing and filing the patent applications. Mr. Chen never
spoke with anyone at Homeland regarding the drafts and/or revisions to the applications. Chen
Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.
While listed as an eligible practitioner, Mr. Chen did not prosecute or transact any
business before the USPTO relating to the patent applications that matured into the ‘750 and
‘640 patents. A review of the file histories for the ‘750 and ‘640 patents (which are publicly
available from the USPTO website, www.uspto.gov) shows that Mr. Cislo executed the papers
associated with the filing of the patent applications. Any prosecution conducted on these patent
applications was conducted after Mr. Chen’s departure from Cislo. Id. at ¶ 6.
Mr. Chen has no recollection of speaking with Mr. Cislo regarding any communications
with examiners at the USPTO regarding Homeland’s patent applications that matured into the
‘750 and ‘640 patents.

Mr. Chen does not recall any substantive conversation with any

examiners regarding the applications that led to the ‘750 and ‘640 patents. In fact, a review of
the file wrapper of these cases shows that there were no substantive communications regarding
these applications. Id. at ¶ 7.
Mr. Chen’s assistant would generally draft the various reporting and status letters for Mr.
Cislo’s review and execution. Generally, these letters were template-driven. Without reviewing
the redacted content in the letters attached as Exhibit 4 to the Cislo Declaration, Mr. Chen cannot
determine whether they were template-driven. Id. at ¶ 8.

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Mr. Chen drafted the Petition to Make Special regarding the application leading to the
‘750 patent for Mr. Cislo’s review and execution. See Cislo Declaration, Ex. 5. The Petition to
Make Special allows an Applicant to have their patent application examined out of turn (i.e.,
examined sooner) provided that the Applicant pays a fee, accepts any restriction requirements,
submits the results of a patentability search, and discusses how the claimed subject matter is
patentable over the submitted references. Again, all this material is available publicly at the
USPTO website. Id.
Mr. Chen has no recollection of Homeland’s patent enforcement program or assessing
Homeland’s patent portfolio since none of Homeland’s applications had matured into issued U.S.
patents during Mr. Chen’s tenure at Cislo. Chen Decl. ¶ 10.
Mr. Chen had minimal exposure to patent litigation prior to joining and during his tenure
at Cislo as a third-year associate. In fact, Mr. Chen’s involvement with drafting of the complaint
in the Homeland Housewares v. TriStar Products matter was the first, if not the only, litigation
matter he was involved with at Cislo. Given Mr. Chen’s complete lack of prior litigation
experience in drafting the complaint, he was not in a position to formulate litigation strategy.
Mr. Chen had no recollection of discussing any pre-litigation strategy or matters with anyone at
Homeland. At the date of his departure from Cislo, June 11, 2004, there had been no further
filings by Homeland in the case. Mr. Chen joined Steptoe as an associate in the Century City,
California office in 2006. He has had no involvement with this action, except during Steptoe’s
conflict review (as explained below) and, subsequent to the filing of Homeland’s motion, for his
communications with Steptoe attorneys solely with respect to that motion. Id. at ¶ 11.

Steptoe’s Conflict Review Procedure
In the process of undertaking the representation of Sunbeam in this action, Steptoe
identified and evaluated Mr. Chen’s prior work for Homeland for potential conflict of interest,
and properly determined that there was no substantial relationship between Mr. Chen’s patent
prosecution work for Homeland and Sunbeam’s patent infringement claims. See Declaration of
Alfred Mamlet (Ex. 2).
When a new client matter is opened, the requesting attorney must complete and sign a
new matter form. Upon completion, the new matter form undergoes a business intake/conflict of
interest review system that incorporates Steptoe’s billing and ethics policies with defined
procedures to accept the representation of each client and to open, close, and reactivate each
client matter. This system requires specific business intake forms and a strict schedule of
procedures. Mamlet Decl. ¶ 2.
This conflicts search involves a review of any actual or potential conflicts with Steptoe’s
current clients, former clients, co-defendants, or co-plaintiffs of the potential client and other
parties that are either adverse or aligned with the potential client. The results of the database
search are then forwarded to the originating attorney and practice group leader for review. Id. at
¶¶ 3-4.
All new matters require the approval of the relevant practice group leader, and the
practice group leaders are responsible for resolving any substantive conflict issues that appear
during the conflict review process. Similarly, the practice group leader is charged with
determining whether any issue conflicts exist as to the proposed client or matter. Id. at ¶ 5.
No new matter may be formally accepted until a Firm-approved engagement letter is sent
to the client for consent and signature. As a matter of professional ethics and Firm policy,

-5-

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 6 of 17

Steptoe has a rule that no privileged information be received from, and no legal advice given to,
the subject client until the Firm is assured that no conflict exists. Id. at ¶ 6.
In December 2009, Mr. Mamlet, Steptoe’s Intellectual Property Group Leader, received
and reviewed the Conflict of Interest Report generated in response to the request to open the
patent infringement matter for Sunbeam. Mr. Mamlet understood that Steptoe was being asked
to represent Sunbeam in asserting patent infringement claims relating to Sunbeam’s patents for
blenders. The Conflict of Interest Report identified Homeland, among others, as an adversary.
The Conflict of Interest Report also indicated that Andrew Chen had performed legal services for
Homeland prior to joining Steptoe in 2006. Id. at ¶ 7.
To determine whether Mr. Chen’s prior representation of Homeland created a conflict
that would preclude Steptoe from representing Sunbeam in the patent infringement action against
Homeland, Mr. Mamlet called Mr. Chen to discuss his work for Homeland. Mr. Chen explained
that he had performed some patent prosecution work for Homeland. Id. at ¶ 8; Chen Decl. ¶ 13.
Based upon the information received from Mr. Chen, Mr. Mamlet concluded that Mr.
Chen’s patent prosecution work for Homeland and Sunbeam’s patent infringement claims were
not the same or substantially related.1 Mr. Chen had not conducted a “freedom to operate” study,
analyzed a Sunbeam assertion letter, or otherwise engaged in work on the Sunbeam patents at
issue.

Moreover, Sunbeam’s infringement action did not challenge or even implicate

Homeland’s patents, including the patents issued pursuant to the applications prepared by Mr.
Chen. Mamlet Decl. ¶ 9.

Sunbeam acknowledges that Mr. Chen had an attorney-client relationship with
Homeland while he was employed at Cislo & Thomas.

The Markman Hearing
Homeland’s patents appeared for the first time in this case in connection with the
Markman hearing. As the Court is aware, Homeland has asked the Court to assign convoluted
definitions to such simple terms as “cap” in an attempt to rewrite Sunbeam’s patents to avoid
infringement. The Court referred to this as the “apex” of the process gone wrong. 5/17/10
Hearing Tr. at 5 (“The practice has evolved into trying to get one up on summary judgment, and
this case presents the apex of the madness which claim construction has become . . . .”).
In its Markman brief, Homeland first introduced figures from Homeland’s accused
products – (compare Dkt. No. 75 at 21 with Figures 15 and 16 of Homeland’s patents in Dkt. No.
79 at 9) – to argue that such structures are not covered by Sunbeam’s claims. (Homeland did not
disclose that the drawings came from a Homeland patent.) Homeland also relied extensively on
other extrinsic evidence in its attempt to avoid infringement.
Sunbeam objected to any use of extrinsic evidence, including Homeland’s drawings.
Sunbeam took the position that the simple terms of the patents required no construction, and
extrinsic evidence was neither required nor appropriate. Sunbeam’s Opening Markman Brief at
8 (citing TIP Sys., LLC v. Philips & Brooks/Gladwin, Inc., 529 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2008);
Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (stating that extrinsic evidence is
less reliable than the patent and its prosecution history because “[i]n the course of litigation, each
party will naturally choose the pieces of extrinsic evidence most favorable to its cause, leaving
the court with the considerable task of filtering the useful evidence from the fluff.”)); Sunbeam’s
Reply Markman Brief at 3, 10.
Yet, while maintaining that Homeland’s extrinsic evidence was irrelevant, Sunbeam
could not allow it to go unrebutted.

In its Markman Reply Brief, Sunbeam addressed

-7-

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 8 of 17

Homeland’s patents to demonstrate the inconsistencies in the convoluted claim constructions
proposed by Homeland.
Specifically, Homeland had proposed that the simple term “cap” in Sunbeam’s claims
must be a removable structure that cannot contain any holes and must completely cover a
container. See Dkt. No. 75 at 5-10; 5/17/10 Tr. at 44, lines 21- 25. To rebut this argument and
Homeland’s improper use of this extrinsic evidence during Markman, Sunbeam demonstrated to
the Court that Homeland, when it obtained its own patents, represented to the Patent Office that
these same structures were indeed referred to as “caps,” thus revealing the inconsistencies in
Homeland’s argument.2 See Sunbeam Markman Reply Brief at 8-9.
Homeland’s response to this revelation was to argue that its patents were of no probative
value. At the Markman hearing, Homeland argued that its patents were irrelevant and should be
disregarded:
Mr. Cislo: [T]hose [Homeland] patents were filed many years
after Sunbeam’s patent was filed and is not something a person of
ordinary skill in the art would have looked at at the time of the
filing of the patent and is totally inappropriate to show the Court.
To accept that some patent lawyer, myself or anyone else, would
have used that term more generically outside and apart from this
specification in this patent is improper. That is truly improper.

5/17/10 Hearing Tr. at 57, lines 12-19. The Court seemed to agree that Homeland’s patents were
inapposite to how the claim terms of Sunbeam’s patents would be understood by one of ordinary
skill in the art because they were filed later in time. See 5/17/10 Hearing Tr. at 86, lines 15-23.
Having improperly injected its patents into the Markman process, Homeland has now
compounded its abuse by seeking to use those patents to disqualify Sunbeam’s counsel.
The Standard of Review
Disqualification of an attorney “is a serious matter which cannot be based on imagined
scenarios of conflict, and the moving party has a high standard of proof to meet in order to prove
that counsel should be disqualified.” Kronberg v. Larouche, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35097, * 5
(E.D. Va. April 9, 2010) (citations omitted). The Court must balance several factors in deciding
a motion to disqualify, including a party’s right to retain counsel of her choice, the substantial
hardship that could result from disqualification, and the public perception of and the public trust
in the judicial system. Id.; Sanford v. Comm. of Virginia, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113279, * 2932 (E.D. Va. Dec. 2, 2009).
The relevant rule in Virginia provides:
A lawyer who has represented a client in a matter shall not
thereafter represent another person in the same or substantially
related matter if the interest of that person is adverse in any
material respect to the interest of the former client unless the
former client consents after disclosure.
Va. Rule of Prof’l Conduct 1.9(a).
There is a well-established analytical framework for reviewing motions for
disqualification on the basis of conflict of interest. Initially, the Court must determine whether a
conflict exists, and if so, whether the drastic remedy of disqualification is warranted. To support
its claim of conflict of interest, Homeland must establish that an attorney-client relationship

-9-

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 10 of 17

existed between Homeland and Mr. Chen and that the former representation and the current
infringement suit are substantially related.

Lifenet, Inc. v. Musculoskeletal Transplant

Foundation, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29058, * 5 (E.D. Va. April 19, 2007) (citations omitted).
“Substantially related” has been defined to be “identical” or essentially the same. Id. The phrase
has also been used to describe a scenario where “the lawyer could have obtained confidential
information in the first representation that would have been relevant in the second.” Tessier v.
Plastic Surgery Specialists, Inc., 731 F. Supp. 724, 730 (E.D. Va. 1990) (quoting Analytica, Inc.
v. NPD Research, Inc., 708 F.2d 1263, 1266 (7th Cir. 1983)).
With these standards in mind, it is clear that Mr. Chen’s work for Homeland and this
action are not substantially related.
I.

THE HOMELAND PATENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT HERE.
Homeland’s newly-minted position that Mr. Chen’s past representation and this action

are substantially related is a complete reversal from its position at Markman. Homeland cannot
have it both ways.
Homeland’s patents have nothing to do with this case. The patent infringement issue in
this case is whether Homeland’s blenders, and the methods of using them, infringe Sunbeam’s
patents. The infringement issues focus on whether Homeland’s accused products contain each
and every element of the asserted claims of Sunbeam’s apparatus claims, and whether the
methods it instructs consumers to use contain each and every element of Sunbeam’s method
claims. Homeland’s accused products, their specific features, and their methods of use, are
gleaned from the products themselves, Homeland’s product specifications, literature, and
marketing and advertising materials.
Put simply, Homeland’s patents are not accused of infringement; its products are.
Indeed, there are key features of Homeland’s products (the Flip Top Lids) not disclosed in its
- 10 -

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 11 of 17

patents that are central to the issue of infringement and which, according to Homeland, were not
introduced into their products until 2009 – long after Mr. Chen’s employ at Cislo & Thomas, and
long after the 2003 filing date of Homeland’s patents. Accordingly, Homeland’s patents are not
and will not be relevant to this case.
Moreover, Homeland’s patents are not the subject of a counterclaim, and they are not
involved in the Defendants’ invalidity defenses. Neither Homeland nor any other Defendant has
asserted them as prior art to Sunbeam’s patents. Indeed, as stated by Homeland at the Markman
hearing and recognized by the Court, Homeland’s patents were filed “many years after
Sunbeam’s patent” and therefore are not prior art to Sunbeam’s patents. 5/17/10 Hearing Tr. at
57, lines 12-13.
Finally, even if they were somehow found to be relevant, the knowledge of the drafter is
not. The patent would be at issue for what it says, not for who wrote it. After a patent had
issued, the information contained within it is ordinarily regarded as public. On-Line Techs., Inc.
v. Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GMBH, 386 F.3d 1133, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Nowhere in Mr.
Cislo’s declaration is there any statement that he conveyed to Mr. Chen Homeland’s reasoning
behind the terminology used in its patents. Mr. Chen recalls no such communication, and
currently has no knowledge on that subject. Accordingly, Homeland cannot rely on its patent
applications to conjure a conflict, nor can it invoke non-public “reasoning behind the
terminology” when there is no evidence in this record that such reasoning ever existed, let alone
that it was conveyed to Mr. Chen.
Homeland relies on Stratagene v. Invitrogen Corp., 225 F.Supp.2d 608 (D. Md. 2002).
Stratagene provides a dramatic contrast with Homeland’s motion here, illustrating the
circumstances that warrant disqualification. In Stratagene, the plaintiff filed a complaint for

- 11 -

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 12 of 17

infringement of its ‘772 patent. Invitrogen filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment
of invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement of the ‘772 patent. The court disqualified
Invitrogen’s counsel because she had represented Stratagene in connection with an application
for a patent that derived from the same original parent application as the ‘772 patent at issue in
the case.
Stratagene’s original patent application was filed in December 1993. In February 1994,
Stratagene filed a separate patent application, called a “continuation-in-part” of the December
1993 application. The continuation-in-part application was assigned a serial number and referred
to as the ‘791 application. Stratagene prosecuted the continuation-in-part application, which
ultimately resulted in the issuance of the ‘772 patent in September 1996. In September 1995,
Stratagene filed another continuation application, which was given the serial number ‘767
application. Stratagene asserted that both the ‘791 and ‘767 continuation applications were
derived from the text of the original application filed in December 1993.
During the litigation, Stratagene learned that the defendant’s counsel had represented
Strategene concerning the ‘767 application. Because the ‘767 continuation application derived
from the original parent patent application, which ultimately resulted in the issuance of patent
‘772, the court concluded that potentially revealed confidences regarding the ‘767 application
could be relevant to the infringement action concerning the ‘772 patent.

Since the ‘767

application was a continuation of the original application that matured into the ‘772 patent, the
court concluded that the ‘772 patent and the ’767 continuation application were substantially
related.
Stratagene is inapposite because Homeland’s patents are neither in dispute nor relevant in
this action. There is no claim for infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability relating to any

- 12 -

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 13 of 17

Homeland patents. Any work performed by Mr. Chen on Homeland patent applications, or
knowledge gleaned in that process that is not included in the applications, is simply not at issue
here. This case does not involve the content or interpretation of any information that Mr. Chen
might possess.

Any confidences that Mr. Chen received in his previous representation of

Homeland – and there is nothing in this record to show that he received such confidences in
connection with Homeland’s now-public patent applications – are not relevant to determining
whether Homeland infringed Sunbeam’s patents, and therefore the matters are not substantially
related.
II.

THE TRISTAR ACTION.
Finally, Homeland asserts that Mr. Chen’s participation in Homeland Housewares LLC v.

Tristar Products, Inc., No. 04-CV-2831 (C.D. Ca. 2004) provided him with significant
Homeland litigation confidences. Mem. at 12. This argument is no better than frivolous.
The complaint in the Tristar action was filed on April 23, 2004; Mr. Chen left Cislo’s
employ on June 11, 2004. Homeland’s disqualification motion does not assert, nor could it, that
during the short-lived Chen-Homeland relationship, Mr. Chen played a material role in
Homeland’s litigation. Rather, Mr. Chen’s litigation activity for Homeland, as a fourth year
associate, was restricted in time, scope and substance to drafting the complaint (his first) and
follow on matters.
Mr. Chen had no communication with Homeland, let alone any communication regarding
Homeland’s “litigation strategy” that Sunbeam could now use against it. Nowhere in Mr. Cislo’s
Declaration is there any suggestion of what such a strategy might have entailed, or how any such
strategy is relevant to this action. Homeland’s claim to a generalized “strategy” with regard to
litigation or settlement is insufficient to disqualify opposing counsel. See The Nichols Agency,
Inc. v. Enchanted Child Care, Inc., 537 F. Supp. 2d 774, 782 (D. Md. 2008) (citation omitted).
- 13 -

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 14 of 17

Significantly, Homeland does not assert that the Tristar action is substantially related to
this action. In the Tristar action, Homeland asserted a claim of patent infringement and other
claims relating to Homeland’s patent D487,668 (“the ‘668 patent”). See Chen Decl. Ex. A. The
“D” in front of the number, indicates that the ‘668 patent is a design patent. A design patent
covers the look of the design, not its functionality. Richardson v. Stanley Works, Inc., 597 F.3d
1288, 1293-94 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The “ordinary observer” test is the sole test for determining
whether a design patent has been infringed. Id. at 1295 (citation omitted). Thus the Tristar
action only concerned whether the Tristar product looked like the drawings in Homeland’s ‘668
patent and therefore infringed that patent.
The instant action does not involve design patents; it involves utility patents. What
Homeland’s products look like (or their general appearance) is not at issue here. What is at issue
is whether the elements claimed in Sunbeam’s patents – the structural or physical features of the
claim – are present in Homeland’s accused products and also whether the process steps claimed
in Sunbeam’s method claims are performed when Homeland’s products are used.
III.

THE TIMING OF HOMELAND’S MOTION.
Homeland’s motion was filed after Sunbeam’s motion to disqualify Dan Cislo, who is a

necessary fact witness. Sunbeam’s motion could not have surprised Homeland, as Homeland
knew from the beginning that Mr. Cislo could not be both a fact witness and an advocate. The
lack of any merit in Homeland’s motion to disqualify Sunbeam’s counsel, and Homeland’s
incessant prior efforts to delay this action, lead inexorably to the conclusion that it was filed as a
defensive reaction to Sunbeam’s motion and as a tactical maneuver for purposes of delay.
IV.

EFFICIENCY/HARDSHIP.
The substantial prejudice to Sunbeam from disqualification is manifest. This action is far

along and the scope of work performed by Steptoe here has been broad and substantial. The
- 14 -

Case 3:09-cv-00791-REP Document 111

Filed 06/11/10 Page 15 of 17

Court has conducted the Markman hearing, expert reports are due soon, depositions and other
discovery will conclude in August, a summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 5, and
trial is set for January 10, 2011. Substitute counsel would undoubtedly require several months to
familiarize themselves with this case, disrupting the schedule. In fact, Homeland’s motion is but
the latest step in its ongoing quest to delay this action.

Moreover, Homeland is the sole

defendant seeking disqualification.
The Fourth Circuit has also counseled trial courts to avoid “a mechanical application” of
the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct:
It behooves this court, therefore, while mindful of the existing
Code, to examine afresh the problems sought to be met by the
Code, to weigh for itself what those problems are, how real in the
practical world they are in fact, and whether a mechanical and
didactic application of the Code to all situations automatically
might not be productive of more harm than good, by requiring that
the client and the judicial system to sacrifice more than the value
of the presumed benefits.
Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. United States, 570 F.2d 1197, 1202 (4th Cir. 1978).3

In Aetna, the Fourth Circuit was referring to the Virginia Code of Professional
Responsibility, which was replaced by the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct on January 1,
2000. The current version of the Virginia rules is not substantively different from the 2000
version for purposes of this issue.
