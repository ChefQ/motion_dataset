UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY
BLACK MOUNTAIN EQUITIES, INC.,
Docket No. 2:12-cv-01285-ES-CLW
Plaintiff,
-against-
PACIFIC GOLD CORP.,
Defendant.

 

 

PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
OF ITS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

This memorandum of law is submitted by plaintiff Black Mountain Equities, Inc. ("Black
Mountain") in support of its motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 for a preliminary injunction against
defendant Pacific Gold Corp. ("PCFG"'). Black Mountain seeks an order, pending final
determination of this action, directing PCFG to deliver immediately 44,509,090 shares of its
common stock owed pursuant to the terms of the Warrant to Purchase Common Stock (the

"`Warrant") exercised by Black Mountain in March 2012.

Preliminary Statement

In February 2012, plaintiff Black Mountain exercised a Warrant, dated February 26,

2007, issued by defendant Pacific Gold Corp. ("PCFG"). As a result of the exercise, plaintiff

1635164-1
Case 2:12-cv-01285-KM-CLW Documenti6 Filed 04/27/12 Page 7 of 22 PagelD: 453

became entitled to receive approximately 44.5 million shares of PCFG common stock. PCFG
has refused to deliver the shares. There can be no dispute that, under the plain terms of the
Warrant, adjustments to both the exercise price and the number of shares occurred based on
PCFG?'s issuance of stock to another investor, Crescent International, Ltd. ("Crescent") at $.0099
per share. Indeed, PCFG apparently does not challenge the wording or operation of the Warrant.
Instead, it contends that a side letter executed when Crescent made its loan on October 5, 2007
(the "October 5 Letter") provides an exemption for the later issuances to Crescent at $.0099 per
share. The October 5 Letter is clear, however, that any exemption applies only to the issuances
under the Crescent loan "upon the terms as originally issued on the date hereof." The Crescent
loan's conversion rate "as originally issued" was $0.18 per share. To cut short the very
arguments now made by PCFG, the October 5 Letter adds that any adjustment to the conversion
rate in the Crescent Debenture will result in a corresponding adjustment to the exercise price of
the Warrant, stating that "if the Crescent Debenture conversion rate ... is adjusted then the
exercise price of [the Warrant] ... shall ... be adjusted pursuant to Section 8 [of the Warrant]...."

PCFG's SEC filings and discovery in this case confirm that the conversion rate for the
Crescent Debenture, namely the price attributed to shares issued to Crescent as payment, indeed
adjusted in late 2008, down to $.0099 per share. The reduction from $.18 to $.0099 caused
massive dilution to all PCFG investors, including the holder of the Warrant. As a protection
against such dilution, the Warrant requires a corresponding adjustment to its exercise price.
PCFG is mistaken in relying upon the October 5 Letter for an exemption.

Preliminary injunctive relief is urgently required based on plaintiffs clear likelihood of
success on the merits and the inadequacy of a money damage remedy. PCFG's financial

condition is bleak. Its liabilities far exceed its assets. For many years, PCFG has suffered large

1635164-1
Case 2:12-cv-01285-KM-CLW Document 16 Filed 04/27/12 Page 8 of 22 PagelD: 454

losses and today its ordinary expenses far exceed its revenue. PCFG shares trade at
approximately $.01. Absent an injunction directing the issuance of shares to Black Mountain,
there is little prospect that Black Mountain will be able to recover on any money damage award.
Plaintiff is providing the Court with a compendium of cases cited in this brief granting
preliminary injunctive relief under identical circumstances.
Statement of Facts

The facts set forth below are based on the accompanying Declarations of Adam Baker,
dated April 27, 2012, and Thomas J. Fleming, dated April 27, 2012, and the exhibits annexed to
these declarations.

The Parties

Plaintiff Black Mountain is a California corporation with its principal place of business in
San Diego, CA 92129. Black Mountain invests in startups, distressed and other equity
opportunities. (Baker Dec. { 2)

Defendant PCFG is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Las
Vegas, Nevada 89107. PCFG, according to its public filings, is engaged in the identification,
acquisition, and development of prospects believed to have gold mineralization, and owns certain
mining claims, property, and leases in Nevada and Colorado. PCFG's shares trade in the
NASDAQ "pink sheets, under the symbol "PCFG." Its shares now trade at approximately $.01.
According to its most recent annual filing with the SEC there are approximately 837 million
shares outstanding. (Baker Dec. 0x00A7 3)

The Warrant .

On February 26, 2007, PCFG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Cornell
Capital Partners LP (now known as YA Global Investments L.P. ("YAG" or "YA Global'')) for

the sale of up to $2,440,000 principal amount of convertible debentures and warrants to purchase

1635164-1

 
Case 2:12-cv-01285-KM-CLW Document16 Filed 04/27/12 Page 9 of 22 PagelD: 455

6,000,000 shares of common stock. (Fleming Dec. Ex. 14) Pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement, PCFG issued to YAG a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock dated February 26,
2007 (the "Warrant" or the "YAG Warrant"). The Expiration Date of the Warrant was February
26, 2012.

On February 14, 2012, Black Mountain purchased the Warrant from YAG. (Baker Dec.
Ex. 2) The Warrant allowed Black Mountain to subscribe for and purchase from PCFG up to six
million (6,000,000) shares of PCFG common stock, subject to adjustments, upon submission of
an Exercise Notice. The Warrant contained an initial Exercise Price of $0.216, which is also
subject to adjustment. (Baker Dec. Ex. 1)

In Section 8(a) of the Warrant, PCFG agreed that the initial Exercise Price of the Warrant
was subject to downward adjustment in the event PCFG later issued shares, or securities
convertible into shares, at a price that was lower than the then Exercise Price. Thus, the Warrant

provides, in relevant part:

If and whenever the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued
or sold, any shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Securities) for
a consideration per share less than a price (the "Applicable Price") equal
to the Warrant Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
or sale, then immediately after such issue or sale the Warrant Exercise
Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to such
consideration per share.

(Baker Dec. Ex. 1, 0x00A7 8(a).)

The Warrant also provided that, as the exercise price adjusted, the number of shares to be

issued would also change. Section 8(a) further provides:

Upon each such adjustment of the Warrant Exercise Price hereunder, the
number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
adjusted to the number of shares determined by multiplying the Warrant
Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the
number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by
the Warrant Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.

Ud.)
The Crescent Issuance

In October 2007, PCFG obtained financing from Crescent International, Ltd.
("Crescent"). (Baker Dec. 0x00A7 8, Ex. 4) Crescent received a convertible note (the "Crescent
Debenture" or the "Debenture"), at an initial exercise price of $0.18 per share, subject to
adjustment under a variety of scenarios. (/d. Exs. 5 & 6) In late 2008 and early 2009, PCFG
issued approximately 8,080,000 shares to Crescent pursuant to the Debenture, at $.0099 per
share. (Fleming Dec. Ex. 12) Crescent's 2008 Form 10-K disclosed that "[d]uring 2008 the
conversion price [of the Crescent Debenture] was readjusted to $0.0099 and the note was
revalued at this time," and also that "During the fourth quarter upon conversion of outstanding
promissory notes, Pacific Gold issued from time to time an aggregate of 9,189,250 shares of
common stock at a conversion price ranging between $0,0042 to $0.0099 .. ." (Baker Dec.
Ex. 7)

Black Mountain's Exercise Notice

Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Warrant, the issuance of shares pursuant to the Crescent
Debenture at $.0099 automatically adjusted the exercise price of the YA Warrant downward to
$0.0099. (Baker Dec. 0x00A7 1)

On February 22, 2012, Black Mountain made a cashless exercise of its Warrant, properly
delivering its Exercise Notice to PCFG. Pursuant to the Exercise Notice, Black Mountain was
entitled to receive at least 44,509,090 shares of PCFG common stock, based on the adjusted
exercise price of $0.0099. (Baker Dec. J 11, Ex. 8)

By letter dated February 23, 2012, PCFG rejected Black Mountain's Exercise Notice,

stating that PCFG would not deliver any shares. (Baker Dec. J 12, Ex. 9)
