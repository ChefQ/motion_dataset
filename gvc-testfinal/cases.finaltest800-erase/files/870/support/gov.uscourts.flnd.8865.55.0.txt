PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO VIEW SECOND AND THIRD DECLARATIONS OF
SPECIAL AGENT TANYA D. BURGESS

Plaintiff Ward Dean, pro se, files this "Motion to View Second and Third
Declarations of Special Agent Tanya Burgess." In support of this request, plaintiff would
show the following:

1. Defendants filed their pleading entitled "Motion to file Second declaration of
Tanya D. Burgess with Restrictions and to File the Third Declaration of Tanya
Burgess Under Seal and Ex Parte" on September 9, 2003.

2. Although the defendants requested that only the Third Declaration be filed Jn
Camera and Ex Parte, and that the Second Declaration be filed only with certain
restrictions placed upon the Plaintiff, on October 14, 2003, despite the absence of any Order
granting the motion referred to in paragraph 1 herein, both the Second and Third

declarations of Tanya D. Burgess were filed Ja Camera and Ex Parte. Withholding the
contents of the Second Declaration is clearly beyond the scope of what was requested by
the defendants.

3. Plaintiff herein submits that the intended purpose of the Second and Third
declarations of Tanya D. Burgess was not only to maintain confidentiality of
certain alleged "evidence" and investigative techniques of the government, but also to
prevent Plaintiff from perfecting discovery. Defendants are attempting to close this case, in
their favor, with unknown allegations and materials, the validity of which Plaintiff has no
ability to rebut.

4, On 1 December, 2003, prior to filing this motion under Local Rule 7.1(B),
Plaimtiff conferred with counsel for the Defendants, in a good faith effort to resolve by
agreement the issues raised, but was unable to resolve the issue raised by this motion.

Wherefore, Plaintiff herein contends that he must be afforded the opportunity
- to review and rebut these recent declarations of Agent Burgess, minus any material
included therein which the Court believes must be redacted to protect the legitimate
interests of the Defendants. To refuse Plaintiff the opportunity to rebut any alleged
evidence flies in the face of justice. If the Defendants are to be allowed to communicate
privately with the impartial Adjutant of facts in this case, then Plaintiff must ask when the
scales have been stolen from the hand of justice?
