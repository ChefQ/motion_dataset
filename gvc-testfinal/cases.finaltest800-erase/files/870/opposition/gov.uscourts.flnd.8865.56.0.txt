DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S
MOTION TO VIEW SECOND AND THIRD
DECLARATIONS OF SPECIAL AGENT TANYA D. BURGESS
QUESTION PRESENTED
Plaintiff seeks to view the Second and Third Declarations of Tanya D. Burgess, which
were sealed by the Court. His request is based on the grounds that defendants did not seek to seal
the second declaration and that now the declarations are now being relied upon in support of the
defendants' motion for summary judgment. But the declarations contain sensitive investigative
information, which the Court did not rely on, and the United States has not cited to the
declarations in its motion for summary judgment. Has plaintiff provided a sufficient basis to
reverse the Court's order and view the sealed documents?
STATEMENT

On or about September 5, 2003, the United States and the Internal Revenue Service:

(collectively, "United States") filed a renewed motion to stay these proceedings. {Docket No.
Case 3:03-cv-00065-MCR-MD Document 56 Filed 12/11/03 Page 2 of 6

22.] Concurrent with the renewed motion to stay, the United States sought leave to file the
second declaration of Special Agent Burgess with restrictions and the third declaration of Special
Agent Burgess under seal. [Docket No. 24.] These declarations were intended to support the
United States' renewed motion to stay the proceedings. But even before the United States filed
the second and third declarations to the Court, defendants' request for a stay was denied on
September 29, 2003. [Docket No. 29.]

The next day, an order was issued requesting that the United States submit the second and
third declarations of Tanya Burgess so a determination could be made if the declarations should
be sealed. [Docket No. 35.] Defendants did so. In accordance with its order, the Court
considered the declarations of Special Agent Burgess and sealed the documents on October 14,
2003. [Docket No. 42.] Because the declarations contain sensitive investigative information and
because the Court did not rely on the declarations in denying the renewed motion to stay, the
Court's decision to seal the declarations was correct and remains so.

Now that more than a month has lapsed, plaintiff voices his disagreement with the Court's
decision and seeks leave to view the declarations. The basis for his motion to view the
declarations is: (1) the United States did not request that Special Agent Burgess' second
declaration be sealed (Pl. Mot. {]1-2); and (2) the United States is now relying on the sealed
declarations in support of its motions for summary judgment (P1. Mot. 493-4). Both of these
contentions are incorrect.

ARGUMENT
The United States intended to file the second declaration of Tanya Burgess in support of

its renewed motion to stay the proceedings. Although the declaration contains sensitive

information, the United States intended to rely on this declaration in support of its motion to stay.
Thus, the United States requested that the Court apply certain restrictions to the second
declaration's use after it was disclosed to plaintiff. But before the declaration was submitted to
the Court or served upon the plaintiff, the United States' renewed motion to stay the proceedings
was denied. Thus, the Court did not even rely on the information contained the declaration. The
Court then, on its own initiative, ordered the United States to submit the second and third
declarations of Tanya Burgess, after the fact, in order to determine if they should be sealed.
[Docket No. 35.] On October 3, 2003, the United States complied by submitting the declarations
for the Court's review in camera, and on October 14, 2003, the documents were sealed.

Even though the United States did not move to seal the second declaration (only the third
declaration), the Court ordered that the declarations be submitted to determine if they should be
sealed and granted the relief that it deemed necessary. Plaintiff comes forward with no
compelling reason that the declaration should be unsealed, especially in light of the fact that the
Court did not take Special Agent Burgess' second or third declarations into consideration when
denying the United States' motion to stay. Because the declarations contain sensitive information
and because the declarations were not relied upon by the Court in denying the motion to stay the
proceedings, plaintiff provides no basis for needing to view the declarations.

Plaintiff makes the second argument that the United States is relying on the sealed
declarations in support of its motion for summary judgment. (P1. Mot. 3-4.) But this is not the
case. The motion for summary judgment only makes reference to and relies on to the Fourth
Declaration of Tanya D. Burgess. Thus, the sealed Second and Third Declarations of Tanya D.

Burgess are not being relied upon, and plaintiff's argument is misplaced.

CONCLUSION
Because plaintiff fails to provide any basis for reviewing the sealed declarations and the
United States does not rely on the sealed documents in support of its motion for summary

judgment, plaintiff's motion to view the declarations must be denied.
