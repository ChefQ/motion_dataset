Case 9:14-cv-80781-RLR Document 303 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2015 Page 1 of 3

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

EDWARD TOBINICK, M.D., et al.,

Case No: 9:14-cv-80781-RLR

Plaintiffs,
v.
STEVEN NOVELLA, M.D, et al.,
Defendants.

DEFENDANT’S LIMITED OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO FILE DOCUMENTS UNDER SEAL
Defendant, Dr. Steven Novella, by and through the undersigned
counsel, hereby files this Limited Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to File
Documents Under Seal (DE 302).
On November 16, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their Motion to File Documents
Under Seal, which contained a paragraph that moved this Court to permit
the filing of the sealed documents in the public record should the Court deny
their motion “for any reason.”
If Plaintiffs’ motion is denied, the materials should not be permitted to
be filed. They contain confidential tax material that bears no relevance to
the issue of whether the articles constituted commercial speech. Defendant
only consented as to their filing status, not their evidentiary value. Filing such
documents in the public record conflicts with Dr. Novella's privacy rights.
