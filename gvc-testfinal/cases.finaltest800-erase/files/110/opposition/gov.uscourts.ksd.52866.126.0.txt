DEFENDANT’S AMENDED RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
COMES NOW the defendant, by and through its attorneys of record John Val Wachtel
and Alexander B. Mitchell, of Klenda, Mitchell, Austerman & Zuercher, L.L.C. and for its
Response to Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, states:
Nature of Motion
Plaintiff seeks to enforce a settlement agreement which it claims was entered into
between the parties’ counsel on March 26, 2007, at approximately 4:55 o’clock p.m. The
defendant claims that although it made several settlement offers, all of which were rejected by
the plaintiff, that on March 26th, and prior to 9:18 a.m., there was a $250,000.00 settlement offer
pending to plaintiff. When at 9:18 o’clock a.m. on that date plaintiff did not accept the offer, but
rather, attempted to persuade the defendant to increase that offer by $50,000.00, it rejected the
offer and counter offered to settle for $300,000.00. The defendant rejected the counteroffer and
did not renew its $250,000.00 settlement offer, and there was no outstanding offer for the
plaintiff to accept, as it attempted to do by e-mail at 4:55 o’clock p.m. on that date. Plaintiff’s
belated attempted at “acceptance” was ineffective, and was in fact an new offer from plaintiff to
settle for $250,000.00. That offer was considered and, on March 30th, it was rejected.

Movant’s Statement of Facts
1. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 1 is not controverted.
2. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 2, although not relevant to these proceedings, is
not controverted.
3. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 3, although not relevant to these proceedings is
not controverted.
4. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 4 is not controverted.
5. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 5 is not controverted.
6. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 6 is not controverted.
7. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 7 is not controverted.
8. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 8 is controverted. On or about March 26th further
discussions were had between plaintiff’s counsel and defendant’s counsel.

During those

discussions plaintiff sought to get defendant to raise its settlement offer. Plaintiff’s counsel was
advised that defendant would not pay $400,000.00 to settle, and that it had authorized its counsel
to again offer $250,000.00 in settlement. Defendant’s counsel further advised even in the event
of further negotiations, that he doubted defendant would pay more than $300,000.00 in
settlement, and that defendant would not accept any offer that increased the settlement amount
by between $50,000.00 and $75,000.00. (See Affidavit of John Val Wachtel, a copy of which is
attached hereto, marked Exhibit A, and incorporated herein by reference.)
9. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 9 is controverted. Defendant does not dispute
what is written in statement 9, it does dispute the implied conclusion that the plaintiff’s March
26,th 9:18 a.m. request that defendant raise its offer was not a rejection of plaintiff’s pending
$250,000.00 settlement offer. (See Affidavit of Wachtel, Exhibit A; Affidavit of Menu Maker’s

President Jon R. Graves, a copy of which is attached hereto, marked Exhibit B, and incorporated
herein by reference and Affidavit of Menu Maker’s General Manager, Creighton Cox, a copy of
which is attached hereto, marked Exhibit C, and incorporated herein by reference.)
10. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 10 is controverted in part. Despite defendant’s
counsel’s e-mail in which he wrote “Dick’s response is that he will not pay $300,000.00 in
settlement of this case. In truth Dick indicated that he was getting ‘iffy’ about his $250,000.00
offer.” The word “iffy” was not Mr. Graves’ rather it was Mr. Cox word, which was wrongfully
attributed to Mr. Graves. (See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel; Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves;
and Exhibit C; Affidavit of Cox.)
11.

Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 11 is not controverted to the extent that

defendant admits that plaintiff’s counsel sent an e-mail to defendant’s counsel on May 26,th at
4:55 p.m., and that e-mail is correctly quoted in statement of facts number 11.
12. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 12 is not controverted.
13. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 13 is not controverted.
14.

Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 14 is not controverted to the extent that

defendant admits that its counsel sent to plaintiff’s counsel the e-mail quoted in part in plaintiff’s
statement of facts number 14.
15. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 15 is not controverted. Defendant admits that
plaintiff’s counsel did send to defendant’s counsel the e-mail quoted in statement of facts number
15.
16. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 16 is not controverted. Defendant admits that
its counsel sent the e-mail quoted by plaintiff in statement of facts number 16.

17. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 17 is controverted. Between March 27th and
March 30th, counsel for the parties continued to have conversations regarding settlement. (See
Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel.) During which time defendant considered whether it would
accept what it considered an offer from the plaintiff to settle for $250,000.00. On March 30th,
defendant rejected that offer. (See Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves.) At approximately 7:00 p.m.
on March 30th, defendant’s counsel informed plaintiff’s counsel of defendant’s decision to reject
the plaintiff’s pending $250,000.00 settlement offer. (See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel.)
18. Plaintiff’s statement of facts number 18 is controverted. Since March 30th, counsel
for the parties have had some contact regarding settlement and the issue presented by plaintiff in
its motion and amended brief in support of that motion. That contact has not been daily. (See
Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel.)
Statement of Additional Facts
1. On or about March 13, 2007 defendant instructed and authorized its counsel to attempt
to settle this case for $250,000.00. (See Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves, ¶ 4.)
2. On March 14th, defendant was advised that plaintiff had made a settlement offer of
$420,000.00, which Mr. Wachtel rejected. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
3. Counsel later reported that on March 16,th he and plaintiff’s counsel had further
settlement discussions during which Mr. Wachtel made an offer to settle in the amount of
$250,000.00, subject to execution of releases by defendant and its shareholders. (Id. at ¶ 7.)
4. Later that that day further discussions were had between counsel for the parties,
during which plaintiff rejected defendant’s offer, and made a $400,000.00 counter offer. (Id. at ¶
8.) Defendant instructed counsel to reject the counteroffer, and to make another offer to settle
for $250,000.00, which counsel did. (Id. at ¶ 9.).

5. On or about March 26th, further settlement discussions occurred between the parties’
counsel, during which plaintiff sought to get defendant to increase its offer. (Id. at ¶ 10.)
6.

During those discussions, defendant’s counsel advised plaintiff’s counsel that

defendant would not pay $400,000.00 in settlement, and that defendant had authorized him to
renew the $250,000.00 offer. Defendant’s counsel further advised that, even in the face of
further negotiations, he doubted that defendant would pay more than $300,000.00 in settlement,
and that defendant would not accept any settlement offer that increased the settlement amount by
between $50,000.00 and $75,000.00. (See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel at ¶ 10.)
7. Later that day Menu Maker’s President, Mr. Graves, was advised by Mr. Cox, its
General Manager, that plaintiff’s counsel had written to Mr. Wachtel and advised that if
defendant would increase its offer to $300,000.00, plaintiff’s counsel would recommend that the
plaintiff accept that offer. Mr. Cox further advised Mr. Graves that Mr. Wachtel indicated to
plaintiff’s counsel that he did not believe defendant would settle for the $300,000.00 offer, but
that he would advise Mr. Graves of the plaintiff’s position. (See Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves
at ¶ ¶ 11, 12 and 13.)
8.

Defendant believed that the $300,000.00 figure was yet another rejection of its

settlement offer. Mr. Cox was told to advise Mr. Wachtel that defendant would not accept a
$300,000.00 settlement offer. Mr. Cox was also told that, in the face of defendant’s offers
having been rejected, defendant was reconsidering whether it was willing to settle at all. (Id. at ¶
13.)
9. Mr. Cox told Mr. Wachtel that Menu Maker would not settle for $300,000.00 and that
Mr. Graves was feeling “iffy” about any settlement. (See Exhibit C, Affidavit of Cox, at ¶ 13.)

10. At approximately 3:51 p.m. on March 26,th defendant’s counsel sent an e-mail to
plaintiff’s counsel which read:

“Dick’s response is that he will not pay $300,000.00 in

settlement of this case. In truth, Dick indicated that he was getting ‘iffy’ about his $250,000.00
offer.” (See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel at ¶ 14.)
11. At approximately 4:55 p.m. on that date, plaintiff’s counsel advised defendant’s
counsel by e-mail that defendant’s $250,000.00 had been “accepted.” (Id. at ¶ 14.)
12. On the morning of March 27th defendant’s counsel and Mr. Cox discussed the
plaintiff’s purported acceptance of defendant’s earlier offer. Mr. Graves could not be contacted
that morning.

Defendant considered the “acceptance” to be a new settlement offer, and

following the discussions, Mr. Wachtel e-mailed Mr. DeVaughn as follows:
I have been unable to communicate with Mr. Graves regarding your e-mail
‘accepting’ our $250,000.00 settlement offer. Given my inability to speak with
Mr. Graves I cannot speak for Menu Maker and confirm that the offer was still
outstanding. I will try diligently to get Mr. Graves on the phone today and
consult with him about this. I expect that I will learn nothing before Wednesday,
at which time I will get back to you.
(Id. at ¶ 16.)
13. Between March 28th and March 30th defendant considered whether to settle for
plaintiff’s $250,000.00 offer. Plaintiff’s counsel was made aware of this. On March 30th,
plaintiff’s offer was rejected. That decision was communicated to plaintiff’s counsel. (Id. at ¶¶
17 and 18. See also Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves, ¶¶ 18 and 19.)
Argument and Authorities
The enforceability of settlement agreements is a matter of state law. United States v.
McCall, 235 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 2000). It is undisputed that, if appropriate under state
law, the United States District Courts have the power to summarily enforce a settlement

6

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 126

Page 7 of 13

agreement entered into while the litigation is pending. United States v. Hardage, 982 F.2d 1491,
1496 (10th Cir. 1993).
Regarding acceptance and rejection of settlement offers is clear. The Kansas Supreme
Court confirmed that:
“Ample Kansas case law supports the hornbook proposition that an
unconditional and positive acceptance is required to form a contract; a conditional
acceptance of a settlement offer is but a counteroffer, which does not create a
contract. Steele v. Harrison, 220 Kan. 422, 428, 552 P.2d 957 (1967)
Nungesser v. Bryant, 2007 WL 858861 *12, ___ Kan. ___, ___ P.3d ___ (2007). Further in
Kansas:
‘It is fundamental that a communicated offer creates a power to accept the offer
that is made, and only that offer. Any expression of assent that changes the
terms of the offer in any material respect may be operative as a counteroffer, but it is not an acceptance and constitutes no contract. Unless the
original offeror subsequently expresses unconditional assent to the counter-offer
there will never be a contract.’
Id. citing Steele v. Harrison, 220 Kan. 422, 428, 552 P.2d 957 (1967) (emphasis added).
See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 59 (1979), and 1 Corbin on Contracts §
3.28, pp. 457-62, Rev. ed. 1993 & 2006 Supp.
What is more, it has long been the law of Kansas that “it is not the function of the
courts to make contracts but to enforce them.”

Fourth National Bank and Trust

Company, Wichita v. Mobil Oil Corporation, 224 Kan. 347, 353, 582 P.2d 236, 241
(1978) citing Springer v. Litsey, 185 Kan. 531, 535, 345 P.2d 669 (1959). In the present
case, the communications between counsel for the parties do not demonstrate the creation
of a contract to settle, and the trial court should not create one.
On March 14, 2007, plaintiff made a $420,000.00 settlement offer. (See Exhibit 1,
plaintiff’s Amended Memorandum.) That offer was rejected. On March 16,th defendant’s

7

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 126

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 8 of 13

counsel e-mailed plaintiff’s counsel memorializing prior conversations of that date and
confirming that defendant’s counsel had been authorized to offer $250,000.00 in settlement.
Defendant’s counsel went on to write:
We talked later in the day. You told me that you had spoken with Mark and
Sheila, and that their offer of settlement was $400,000.00, a 20,000.00 reduction
from your offer of earlier this week. … I told you that it was my opinion that Mr.
Graves would never pay a settlement in that amount. Quite frankly I do not
believe that Mr. Graves will not [sic] even approach that amount. I did tell you
that I would communicate your offer to Mr. Graves …”
(See Exhibit 2, plaintiff’s Amended Memorandum.)

That e-mail and the conversations it

memorialized was a rejection plaintiff’s offer, and defendant’s offer to settle for $250,000.00.
(See Exhibit A, Affidavit of Wachtel, ¶ 9.)
On March 26th further discussions were had regarding settlement. Prior to 9:18 a.m. on
that date defendant’s settlement offer was pending. Plaintiff’s counsel sought to get defendant to
increase its offer to $300,000.00. That attempt was not an acceptance of the defendant’s offer;
rather it was a rejection and a counteroffer. Defense counsel contacted the defendant and
inquired whether the plaintiff’s counteroffer was acceptable.

(Id. at ¶¶ 10 and 11.)

The

defendant advised counsel that it would not accept the counteroffer and that defendant was
feeling “iffy” about its earlier offers.

Defendant’s

rejection of the counteroffer was

communicated to the plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 12 and 13.) Plaintiff was then on notice that as of
defendant’s receipt of the counteroffer, defendant’s latest settlement offer was not pending and
could not be accepted. Full in the knowledge of that information, and on that same date, the
plaintiff attempted to accept defendant’s non existent offer.
The facts demonstrate that plaintiff rejected every offer presented to it. In addition to
plaintiff’s express rejections of settlement, plaintiff, by its continuing attempts to negotiate a
higher settlement offer, had impliedly rejected any pending offers. As of 4:55 p.m. on March

8

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 126

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 9 of 13

26th, there was no offer for plaintiff to accept. Defendant correctly treated plaintiff’s purported
“acceptance” as a new offer from plaintiff to settle. Defendant considered that offer, rejected it
and so advised the plaintiff. (See Exhibit B, Affidavit of Graves, ¶¶ 18 and 19.)
At Kansas law there was never the positive acceptance required to form a contract as
required by Nungesser and Steel. Given plaintiff’s constant rejections of defendant’s settlement
offers and given as well its attempts to negotiate a higher settlement number, there was never an
acceptance and thus no agreement to be enforced. When viewed in a light favorable to the
defendant, the evidence indicates repeated rejections of the defendant’s offers, and, ultimately,
an offer by plaintiff to settle for $250,000.00. That offer was rejected.
“When the evidence pertaining to the existence of a contract or the content of its terms is
conflicting or permits more than one inference, a question of fact is presented. Nungesser at *12.
Kansas courts treat a motion to enforce a settlement agreement, as a motion for summary
judgment, one in which disputed material facts and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom are
resolved in favor of the non-moving party. Id.
The federal summary judgment standard is no different. In applying the standard:
The court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light
most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144
F.3d 665,670 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio
Corp. 475 U.S. 574,587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).
Carolina Industrial Products, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., 189 F.Supp.2d 1147, 1157 (D.Kan. 2001). In
the context of the pending motion, this Court must resolve disputed material facts and
conclusions to be drawn there from in favor of the defendant and accordingly must deny the
plaintiff’s motion.
In an attempt to succeed on its motion, plaintiff relies on Sawtelle v. Cosden Oil & Gas
Co., 128 Kan. 220, 227, 277 Pac 45, 48 (1929) as support for an argument that defendant’s

9

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 126

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 10 of 13

counsel had an implied authority to settle the case. Sawtelle avails the plaintiff nothing. Counsel
for the defendant had the actual authority to offer to settle this case for $250,000.00. Each time
that offer was made it was rejected - either expressly or impliedly as a result of plaintiff’s
constant attempts to negotiate a higher settlement. Now plaintiff seeks to find its way around its
rejections by raising a question of defense counsel’s implied authority.

That argument is

inapplicable, see Nungesser and Steel.
There was no meeting of the minds after the plaintiff rejected the defendant’s March 25th
offer by attempting to persuade the defendant to raise its offer.

Following that rejection,

defendant’s offer was not renewed. While the use of the word “iffy” in describing defendant’s
position on settlement was sufficient to apprise plaintiff that defendant was re-evaluating
whether it wished to settle at all. The word “iffy” does not constitute a renewal of defendant’s
earlier offer, and cannot be so interpreted.
The defendant relies, inter alia, on Krantz v. Univ. of Kan., 271 Kan. 234, 21 P.3d 561
(2001), for the proposition that Kansas favors compromise and settlement of disputes. While
true, plaintiff’s statement fails to point out that Krantz recognizes exceptions.
It is an elemental rule that the law favors compromise and settlement of disputes,
and generally, in the absence of bad faith or fraud, when parties enter into an
agreement settling and adjusting a dispute, neither party is permitted to repudiate
it. However, as an exception to the rule it is well settled that a compromise
settlement may be set aside on the ground of mutual mistake of the parties. In re
Estates of Thompson, 226 Kan. 437, 440, 601 P.2d 1105 (1979).
Krantz, 271 Kan. at 242, 21 P.3d at 567. In any event, Krantz does not stand for the proposition
that courts may create a settlement where none exists.
Defendant’s settlement offers were constantly rejected. Plaintiff sought to persuade
defendant to offer more money.

This conduct constituted rejections of defendant’s offers.

10

Page 11 of 13

Eventually this strategy played out to plaintiff’s detriment. Under the holdings of Nungesser and
Steel, no agreement was reached. Argument that the opposite is so does not make it so.
Conclusion
In Kansas, the law has long been that courts enforce contracts, they do not make them.
Fourth National Bank and Trust Company, Wichita, 224 Kan. at 353, 582 P.2d 241. An offer
creates only the power to accept that offer, and “an expression of assent which changes the terms
of the offer in any material respect may be operative as a counteroffer, but it is not an
acceptance and constitutes no contract.” Nungesser at *12 (emphasis added).
At Kansas law, a motion to enforce a settlement agreement, is treated as if it were a
motion for summary judgment, in which disputed material facts and the conclusions to be drawn
therefrom are resolved in favor of the non-moving party. Id. The federal standard is no
different. Under that standard, all disputed material facts and all reasonable inferences to be
drawn therefrom must be viewed a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Carolina
Industrial Products, Inc. 189 F.Supp.2d at 1157.
Kansas law favors compromise and settlement. Krantz, 271 Kan. at 242, 21 P.3d at 567.
However, there must be some compromise and settlement to favor and enforce. In the present
case there is none. Plaintiff repeatedly rejected the defendant’s settlement offers. Plaintiff
constantly sought to leverage the defendant to increase its offers - obviously implied rejections of
any pending offers. To the extent that the plaintiff’s conduct might somehow be viewed as an
expression of assent, it is apparent that any such expression changed the terms of the then
pending offer(s) in a material respect. Plaintiff’s purported acceptance is nothing more than a
counteroffer which the defendant could, and did, reject. Nungesser at *12.

There is not now, and never has been, a settlement of this case. Under Kansas law, there
is no agreement to be enforced. Any argument regarding defense counsel’s apparent authority is
not germane. The Court should deny the plaintiff’s amended motion to enforce the purported
settlement.
WHEREFORE, the defendant prays that the plaintiff take naught by its amended motion
and that the amended motion be denied
