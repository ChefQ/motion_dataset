MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT

 

Plaintiffs by and through their attorneys of record, Dustin L. DeVaughn and
Richard W. James of McDonald, Tinker, Skaer, Quinn & Herrington, P.A., file this
motion to enforce settlement.

I. NATURE OF THE MOTION.

Defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. through its counsel of record J. Val Wachtel
made an offer to settle this case for $250,000. The offer was accepted by plaintiff's
counsel, Dustin DeVaughn. Upon acceptance of the $250,000 by plaintiff, defendant's
counsel for the first time asserted that he did know for sure if the offer was still
outstanding, but he "believed" it was.

The same day the offer was accepted Mr. DeVaughn previously confirmed with
Mr. Wachtel on the phone the offer was still on the table. Mr. Wachtel even confirmed
the offer was on the table when he wrote in an email that "Dick [defendant's president]
was geetting `iffy' about his $250,000 offer."

Undoubtediy, Mr. Wachtel had actual authority to settle this case for $250,000 or

he never would have made such an offer in writing, confirmed it over the phone, and

Dockets.Justia.com
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 2of 12

suggested that his client was getting "iffy" about his outstanding $250,000 settlement
offer.

Most alarming is plaintiff accepted the "offer" on March 26, 2007, but defendant
has failed to conclusively state to this date whether the case has been settled or not.
Mr. DeVaughn has attempted to communicate with Mr. Wachtel every business day
since Mr. Wachtel first alleged he might not have authority for the agreement. Each day
Mr. Wachtel advises that he is still waiting on his client's position and whether defendant
will abide by the terms of the settlement.

Further, just moments before plaintiff filed its motion to enforce settlement,
defendant has now filed another motion for summary judgment on an issue that has
been decided by this Court twice. The Third Motion for Summary Judgment will [again]
be addressed in a separate pleading if this Court deems it necessary. However, it is
important for this Motion for the Court to note that the Pretrial Order cited by defendant
in support of its Third Motion for Summary Judgment is actually an uncompleted
document, because plaintiffs counsel believed the matter was settled.

While Defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. has not specifically said it is unwilling
to settle the case for $250,000, it is apparently taking the position that there is no formal
settlement. This motion requests enforcement of the settlement agreement.

It. STATEMENT OF FACTS.

1. This breach of contract case has been on file since June 30, 2005.
Defendant's counsel throughout the course of this proceeding has remained the same.
(See Plaintiffs original Complaint [Doc. 1] and Defendant's Answer [Doc. 7]).

2. The parties previously participated in a mediation on May 10, 2006 with
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 3of 12

Dennis Gillen serving as mediator. During the mediation, defendant Menu Maker
Foods, Inc.'s president and sole shareholder Dick Graves attended the same together
with defendant's counsel J. Val Wachtel. A tentative settlement agreement of $400,000
was reached contingent upon Dick Graves obtaining the approval of an anonymous
family member.

3, The tentative settlement agreement of $400,000 failed due to the
anonymous family member's alleged refusal to consent. As a result, litigation
continued.

4, By way of email dated March 14, 2007, plaintiff Monsours, Inc. provided
defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. with a written settlement offer of $420,000. (Exhibit
1).

5. On March 16, 2007, counsel for the parties discussed the case by
telephone and defense counsel provided a settlement offer of $250,000 on behalf of
defendant Menu Maker Food, Inc. (Exhibit 2).

6. Later that day, during a second telephone conference, plaintiff's counsel
rejected that offer and provided a counter offer of $400,000. (Exhibit 2)

7. By way of email sent at 2:50 p.m. on March 16, 2007, defendant Menu
Maker Foods, Inc.'s counsel confirmed the two (2) prior discussions. In that email,
defense counsel specifically advised "| was authorized by Mr, Graves to offer
$250,000 in settlement." (Exhibit 2).

8. On March 26, 2007, plaintiffs counsel contacted defendant Menu Maker
Foods, Inc.'s counsel by telephone to inquire about the status of settlement

negotiations. At that time, defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s counsel advised Menu
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 4of12

Maker Foods, Inc. would never go up $75,000 (to $325,000}, but might go up to
$300,000. Upon inquiry by plaintiffs counsel, defense counsel specifically advised that
defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s settlement offer of $250,000 was still on the table.
(See plaintiffs counsel's contemporaneous notes of March 26, 2007, attached as
Exhibit 3 and DeVaughn Affidavit authenticating contemporaneous notes attached as
Exhibit 11).
9. A short time later that morning, by way of an e-mail sent at 9:18 a.m,
March 26, 2007, plaintiffs counsel did not reject the $250,000 settlement offer that
defendant's counsel confirmed remained on the table, but instead indicated that". . . if
Menu Maker Foods offers $300,000, this firm will recommend the same to the
Monsours." (Exhibit 4).
10. At 3:51 p.m. on March 26, 2007, defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s
counsel responded, in relevant part, that:
"Dick's response is that he will not pay $300,000 in
settlement of this case. In truth, Dick indicated that he was
getting `iffy' about his $250,000 offer."

(Exhibit 5).

11. By way of an e-mail directed from plaintiffs counsel to defendant Menu
Maker Foods, inc.'s counsel at 4:55 p.m. on March 26, 2007, plaintiff's counsel
accepted defendant's outstanding $250,000 settlement offer as follows:

"| just spoke with my clients. They accept Menu Maker's
seitiement offer of $250,000. The PACA lien has been
negotiated down to $50,000 and we will pay it directly from
our trust account. You can confirm that with Larry in

Florida."

Thereafter, payment instructions were provided. (Exhibit 5).
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 5of 12

12. The next day, by way of e-mail dated March 27, 2007, counsel for the
PACA trust beneficiaries confirmed to both plaintiff and defendant's counsel that it
accepted $50,000 in settlement to release their judgment. (Exhibit 6).

13. Also that next day (March 27, 2007), counsel for plaintiff directed an e-mail
to defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s counsel congratulating them on a well-defended
case; requested defense counsel to prepare the journal entry of dismissal and a

proposed release; and advised them that the Court had been contacted regarding

settlement of the case. (Exhibit 7).

14. By way of e-mail sent at 10:09 a.m. on March 27, 2007, defendant Menu

Maker Foods, Inc.'s counsel asserted, in part, the following:

"| have been unable to communicate with Mr. Graves
regarding your e-mail `accepting' our $250,000 settlement
offer. Given my inability to speak with Mr. Graves | cannot
speak for Menu Maker and confirm that the offer was still
outstanding,"

(Exhibit 7).
15. Just twelve (12) minutes after receiving defendant Menu Maker Foods,
Inc.'s e-mail, counsel for plaintiff responded, in part, as follows:

"What?

Val, When you and | spoke yesterday | specifically asked you
if the $250 was still on the table early yesterday morning and
you said it was. My notes from the conversation reference
the same. That is why my 9:18 a.m. email from yesterday
did not reject the 250, but advised we would recommend 300
if Dick would go to that.

Your 3:51 p.m. email from yesterday indicated that Dick
would not go to 300 and was starting to get "iffy" about the
250 settlement offer. That is when my clients accepted the
same, Your 3:51 email never indicated the 250 was off the
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 6 of 12

table."

(Exhibit 8).

16. The final substantive e-mail from defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s
counsel was then sent at 10:39 a.m. on March 27, 2007. This e-mail provided, in

relevant part, as follows:

"| do not remember saying that the offer was still on the
table. 1 recall saying that | believed that it was. | would
have had no authority from Graves regarding whether or not
the offer still lived. If | did in fact say that the offer was still
on the table, | was speaking out of turn and without having
first spoken with Mr. Graves.

With regard to the statement "iffy" | was simply reporting
what Mr. Cox had reported to me."

(Exhibit 8) (Emphasis added).

17. Between Tuesday, March 27, 2007, and the date of this motion, counsel
for the parties have awaited a final decision from defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. to
determine whether a controversy actually exists on this settlement issue. As of the
date of this motion, defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. has not communicated a
decision. (Exhibits 9, 10 and 11).

18. Additionally, the parties' counsel have maintained daily telephone contact
with each other regarding the status of the situation. (Exhibit 11).

lil. ARGUMENTS & AUTHORITIES.

A. Defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. provided its defense counsel with
actual authority to settle this case for $250,000.

Defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. provided its defense counsel with actual

settlement authority of $250,000. (Statement of Facts, paragraphs 5 and 7).
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 7 of 12

Specifically, defendant's counsel advised on March 16, 2007 "I was authorized by Mr.

Graves to offer $250,000 in settlement."

Following a counter offer by plaintiff of $400,000 and defendant's rejection of the
same, counsel for defendant specifically orally advised plaintiff's counsel that defendant
Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s settlement offer of $250,000 was still on the table. (See
Statement of Facts, para. 8). A short time later that same morning, plaintiffs counsel
did not reject the $250,000 settlement offer that defendant's counsel confirmed
remained on the table, but instead indicated that if defendant offered $300,000, that
plaintiffs counsel would recommend the same. (See Statement of Facts, para. 9).

After communicating with defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.'s general manager
Creighton Cox, defendant's counsel propounded an e-mail at 3:51 p.m. on March 26,
2007 advising that defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. would not pay $300,000. The e-
mail continued that "In truth, Dick [Graves] indicated that he was getting `iffy' about his
$250,000 offer." (See Statement of Facts, para. 10).

After communicating with plaintiff, plaintiff's counsel accepted defendant's
$250,000 outstanding settlement offer. (See Statement of Facts, para. 11). Based
upon the above and foregoing, it is clear defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. provided
its counsel with $250,000 settlement authority and never revoked the same.

The relationship between an attorney and a client is one of agency and the
general rules of agency apply to that relationship. Miotk v. Rudy, 4 Kan. App.2d 296,
300, 605 P.2d 587 (1980). An agent may bind a principal when the agent either has

actual or apparent authority to bind that principal. Id. Based upon the facts of this
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JUTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 8 of 12

case, it is crystai clear that defense counsel had actual authority to bind Menu Maker

Foods, Inc. to a settlement of $250,000.
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JUTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 9 of 12

B. Even if this Court finds defense counsel had no actual authority, based
upon the facts of this case, defense counsel had apparent authority to bind

Menu Maker Foods, Inc. to the $250,000 settlement agreement.

Even if, for argument sake, defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc. had
communicated to its defense counsel that its $250,000 was off the table, defense
counsel still had apparent authority to bind Menu Maker Foods, Inc.

In this case, defense counsel has represented defendant Menu Maker Foods,
Inc. since the inception of the case and has engaged in extensive settlement
negotiations on behalf of defendant Menu Maker Foods, Inc.

Plaintiffs counsel specifically recorded in his contemporaneous notes of March
26, 2007 the conversation in which defense counsel advised that defendant Menu
Maker Foods, Inc,'s $250,000 settlement offer was still on the table. (See Statement of
Facts, para. 8 and 15). Defendant's counsel even referred to the $250,000 outstanding
settlement offer in his March 26, 2007 e-mail when he indicated his client was getting
"iffy" about the same. (See Statement of Facts, para. 10). Finally, defendant's counsel
even conceded in his March 27, 2007 e-mail that he in fact had "believed" the
[$250,000] offer was still on the table. (See Statement of Facts, para. 16).

The Kansas Supreme Court in Sawtelle v. Cosden Oil & Gas Co., 128 Kan. 220,
277 P. 45 (1929) examined the settlement of a dispute that arose in the midst of the
drilling of a well between the laborers who were drilling the well and the owners of the
well. Among the myriad of issues raised in the case was the question of whether the
attorney for the defendants had the authority to settle the dispute. The defendants
argued that their attorney had no authority to settle the dispute, invoking the general

rule on the limitations of attorney authority. The Kansas Supreme Court held that there
Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM Document120 Filed 04/03/2007 Page 10 of 12

is a point at which an attorney becomes more than a limited agent of a party and the
party cannot allow the attorney to negotiate a settlement and then try to argue that it
had no notice of the terms of the agreement. The Court held:

The rule that one must ascertain an agent's authority or deal
with him at his peril, and that a special agent cannot bind his
principal when acting outside ihe scope of his authority, is
subject to the qualification that, where an agent is intrusted
with a certain kind of business, he becomes between the
principal and parties dealing with him, the general agent for
such business, and his acts bind the principal, though he
violates a private instruction. ... The reason for this rule is
obvious. No man is at liberty to send a man forth to deal for
him, with secret instructions ... which are not communicated
to those with whom he deals and then when his agent has
deviated from those instructions to say that he was a special
agent, that the instructions was a limitation upon his
authority, and those that dealt with him acted at their peril.

Id.

B. This settlement agreement is a Kansas contract and Kansas law favors the
compromise and settlement of disputes.

The settlement agreement between piaintiff Monsours, Inc. and defendant Menu
Maker Foods, Inc. was offered and accepted within the state of Kansas and, therefore,
is a Kansas contract', The enforceability of a settlement agreement is governed by
state law. See United States v. McCall, 235 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 2000). Under
Kansas law, the court is to enforce settlement agreements "in the absence of bad faith
or fraud." Rogler v. Standard Ins. Co., 271 Kan. 234, 21 P.3d 561, 567 (Kan. 2001),

Krantz v. Univ. of Kan., 271 Kan. 234, 21 P.3d 561, 567 (Kan. 2001). See also Lewis v.

 

' For purposes of interpreting the settlement agreement, Kansas choice of law provisions are used to
ascertain which state's substantive law are to apply. Klaxon Co, v. Stentor Electric Mfg, Co., 313 US.
487, 496 (1941). Kansas law dictates that the law of the state where the !ast act necessary to form a
contract took place governs conflicts over the interpretation of the contract. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Ins. Co., v. Baker, 14 Kan.App. 2d 641, 797 P.2d 168 (1990). Because the settlement
agreement was accepted by plaintiff in Kansas, this state's law applies.
